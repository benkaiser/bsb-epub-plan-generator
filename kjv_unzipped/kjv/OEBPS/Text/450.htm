  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job Acknowledges the Finality of Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Man <i class="calibre6">that is</i> born of a woman <i class="calibre6">is</i> of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who can bring a clean <i class="calibre6">thing</i> out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Seeing his days <i class="calibre6">are</i> determined, the number of his months <i class="calibre6">are</i> with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">Yet</i> through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where <i class="calibre6">is</i> he?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">As</i> the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens <i class="calibre6">be</i> no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>If a man die, shall he live <i class="calibre6">again</i>? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>My transgression <i class="calibre6">is</i> sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow <i class="calibre6">out</i> of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>His sons come to honour, and he knoweth <i class="calibre6">it</i> not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth <i class="calibre6">it</i> not of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</p></div></body></html>
