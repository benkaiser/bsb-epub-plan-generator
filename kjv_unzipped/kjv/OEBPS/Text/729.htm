Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Wherefore, when I came, <i class="calibre6">was there</i> no man? when I called, <i class="calibre6">was there</i> none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no water, and dieth for thirst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.</p>
