<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Who coverest <i class="calibre6">thyself</i> with light as <i class="calibre6">with</i> a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">Who</i> laid the foundations of the earth, <i class="calibre6">that</i> it should not be removed for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thou coveredst it with the deep as <i class="calibre6">with</i> a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He sendeth the springs into the valleys, <i class="calibre6">which</i> run among the hills.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, <i class="calibre6">which</i> sing among the branches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And wine <i class="calibre6">that</i> maketh glad the heart of man, <i class="calibre6">and</i> oil to make <i class="calibre6">his</i> face to shine, and bread <i class="calibre6">which</i> strengtheneth man's heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The trees of the LORD are full <i class="calibre6">of sap</i>; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Where the birds make their nests: <i class="calibre6">as for</i> the stork, the fir trees <i class="calibre6">are</i> her house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The high hills <i class="calibre6">are</i> a refuge for the wild goats; <i class="calibre6">and</i> the rocks for the conies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep <i class="calibre6">forth</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span><i class="calibre6">So is</i> this great and wide sea, wherein <i class="calibre6">are</i> things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>There go the ships: <i class="calibre6">there is</i> that leviathan, <i class="calibre6">whom</i> thou hast made to play therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give <i class="calibre6">them</i> their meat in due season.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span><i class="calibre6">That</i> thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
