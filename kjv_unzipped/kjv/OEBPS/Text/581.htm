<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good <i class="calibre6">things; so that</i> thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He will not always chide: neither will he keep <i class="calibre6">his anger</i> for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For as the heaven is high above the earth, <i class="calibre6">so</i> great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>As far as the east is from the west, <i class="calibre6">so</i> far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Like as a father pitieth <i class="calibre6">his</i> children, <i class="calibre6">so</i> the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we <i class="calibre6">are</i> dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> man, his days <i class="calibre6">are</i> as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>But the mercy of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Bless ye the LORD, all <i class="calibre6">ye</i> his hosts; <i class="calibre6">ye</i> ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</p></div></body></html>
