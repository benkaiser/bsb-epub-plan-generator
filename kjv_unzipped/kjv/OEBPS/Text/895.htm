  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Woe to the Oppressors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And they covet fields, and take <i class="calibre6">them</i> by violence; and houses, and take <i class="calibre6">them</i> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <i class="calibre6">is</i> evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>In that day shall <i class="calibre6">one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i class="calibre6">and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i class="calibre6">it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The False Prophets</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Prophesy ye not, <i class="calibre6">say they to them that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i class="calibre6">that</i> they shall not take shame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>O <i class="calibre6">thou that art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the LORD straitened? <i class="calibre6">are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Arise ye, and depart; for this <i class="calibre6">is</i> not <i class="calibre6">your</i> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <i class="calibre6">you</i>, even with a sore destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Remnant of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i class="calibre6">the multitude of</i> men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</p></div></body></html>
