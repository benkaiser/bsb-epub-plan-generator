<span class="reftext">5</span>Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <i class="calibre6">of the house</i> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <i class="calibre6">one</i> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <i class="calibre6">before</i> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <i class="calibre6">one</i> taken for Ithamar.</p>
