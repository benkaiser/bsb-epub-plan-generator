  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment against Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's rasor, and cause <i class="calibre6">it</i> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <i class="calibre6">hair</i>. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <i class="calibre6">and</i> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <i class="calibre6">for</i> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; This <i class="calibre6">is</i> Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries <i class="calibre6">that are</i> round about her. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about you, <i class="calibre6">and</i> have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about you; 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Wherefore, <i class="calibre6">as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish <i class="calibre6">thee</i>; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</p>
<p class="hdg">Famine, Sword, and Dispersion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i> in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for <i class="calibre6">their</i> destruction, <i class="calibre6">and</i> which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
