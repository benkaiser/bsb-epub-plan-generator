<span class="reftext">2</span>Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: <i class="calibre6">they were</i> judges in Beersheba. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Samuel's Warning About Kings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint <i class="calibre6">them</i> for himself, for his chariots, and <i class="calibre6">to be</i> his horsemen; and <i class="calibre6">some</i> shall run before his chariots. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and <i class="calibre6">will set them</i> to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he will take your daughters <i class="calibre6">to be</i> confectionaries, and <i class="calibre6">to be</i> cooks, and <i class="calibre6">to be</i> bakers. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the best <i class="calibre6">of them</i>, and give <i class="calibre6">them</i> to his servants. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put <i class="calibre6">them</i> to his work. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>
<p class="hdg">God Grants the Request</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city.</p></div></body></html>
