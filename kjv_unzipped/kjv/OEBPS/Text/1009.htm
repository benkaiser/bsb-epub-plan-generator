  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Anointed by Mary<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i class="calibre6">son</i>, which should betray him, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Plot to Kill Lazarus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Triumphal Entry<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Zechariah 9:9-13; Matthew 21:1-11; Mark 11:1-11; Luke 19:28-40)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> they had done these things unto him. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts His Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will <i class="calibre6">my</i> Father honour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, I have both glorified <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and will glorify <i class="calibre6">it</i> again. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i class="calibre6">men</i> unto me. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Unbelief of the People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 
<span class="reftext">38</span>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
<span class="reftext">39</span>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 
<span class="reftext">40</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with <i class="calibre6">their</i> eyes, nor understand with <i class="calibre6">their</i> heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Some Believe in Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <i class="calibre6">him</i>, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
<span class="reftext">43</span>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p></div></body></html>
