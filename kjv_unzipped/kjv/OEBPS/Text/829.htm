<span class="reftext">2</span>Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <i class="calibre6">which art</i> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> of perfect beauty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thy borders <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They have made all thy <i class="calibre6">ship</i> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span><i class="calibre6">Of</i> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <i class="calibre6">of</i> ivory, <i class="calibre6">brought</i> out of the isles of Chittim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise <i class="calibre6">men</i>, O Tyrus, <i class="calibre6">that</i> were in thee, were thy pilots.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The ancients of Gebal and the wise <i class="calibre6">men</i> thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The men of Arvad with thine army <i class="calibre6">were</i> upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Tarshish <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all <i class="calibre6">kind of</i> riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The men of Dedan <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants; many isles <i class="calibre6">were</i> the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> a present horns of ivory and ebony. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Syria <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Judah, and the land of Israel, they <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Damascus <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Dedan <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these <i class="calibre6">were they</i> thy merchants. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Chilmad, <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>These <i class="calibre6">were</i> thy merchants in all sorts <i class="calibre6">of things</i>, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Destruction of Tyre</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in thee, and in all thy company which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And all that handle the oar, the mariners, <i class="calibre6">and</i> all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart <i class="calibre6">and</i> bitter wailing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, What <i class="calibre6">city is</i> like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>In the time <i class="calibre6">when</i> thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in <i class="calibre6">their</i> countenance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never <i class="calibre6">shalt be</i> any more.</p></div></body></html>
