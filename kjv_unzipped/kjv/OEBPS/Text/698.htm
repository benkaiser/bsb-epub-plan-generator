Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, <i class="calibre6">and</i> kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And they shall turn the rivers far away; <i class="calibre6">and</i> the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no <i class="calibre6">more</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices <i class="calibre6">and</i> ponds for fish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Surely the princes of Zoan <i class="calibre6">are</i> fools, the counsel of the wise counsellers of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Where <i class="calibre6">are</i> they? where <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy wise <i class="calibre6">men</i>? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, <i class="calibre6">even they that are</i> the stay of the tribes thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken <i class="calibre6">man</i> staggereth in his vomit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Neither shall there be <i class="calibre6">any</i> work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</p>
<p class="hdg">Blessing to Egypt, Assyria, Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh over it. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal <i class="calibre6">it</i>: and they shall return <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the LORD, and he shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a blessing in the midst of the land: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</p></div></body></html>
