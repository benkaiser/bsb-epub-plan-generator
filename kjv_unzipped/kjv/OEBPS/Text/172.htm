<span class="reftext">2</span>Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he <i class="calibre6">was</i> not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> an inheritance, and <i class="calibre6">so</i> blood be upon thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away <i class="calibre6">the guilt of</i> innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>

<span class="reftext">17</span>Then both the men, between whom the controversy <i class="calibre6">is</i>, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the witness <i class="calibre6">be</i> a false witness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> hath testified falsely against his brother; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.
