<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: <i class="calibre6">but</i> Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>From the sole of the foot even unto the head <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no soundness in it; <i class="calibre6">but</i> wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Your country <i class="calibre6">is</i> desolate, your cities <i class="calibre6">are</i> burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and <i class="calibre6">it is</i> desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, <i class="calibre6">and</i> we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="hdg">Meaningless Offerings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>To what purpose <i class="calibre6">is</i> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; <i class="calibre6">it is</i> iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Zion Corrupted</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Thy princes <i class="calibre6">are</i> rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p></div></body></html>
