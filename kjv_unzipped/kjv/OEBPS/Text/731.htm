  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Deliverance for Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Shake thyself from the dust; arise, <i class="calibre6">and</i> sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day <i class="calibre6">is</i> blasphemed. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore <i class="calibre6">they shall know</i> in that day that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> he that doth speak: behold, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> I.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean <i class="calibre6">thing</i>; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel <i class="calibre6">will be</i> your rereward.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Servant Exalted<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Philippians 2:5-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for <i class="calibre6">that</i> which had not been told them shall they see; and <i class="calibre6">that</i> which they had not heard shall they consider.</p></div></body></html>
