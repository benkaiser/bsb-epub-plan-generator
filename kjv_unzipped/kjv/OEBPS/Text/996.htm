  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Before Pilate<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 27:11-14; John 18:28-40)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this <i class="calibre6">fellow</i> perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and <i class="calibre6">to</i> the people, I find no fault in this man. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Before Herod</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long <i class="calibre6">season</i>, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 27:15-23; Mark 15:6-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined <i class="calibre6">him</i> before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>I will therefore chastise him, and release <i class="calibre6">him</i>. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this <i class="calibre6">man</i>, and release unto us Barabbas: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But they cried, saying, Crucify <i class="calibre6">him</i>, crucify him. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let <i class="calibre6">him</i> go. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Crucifixion<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 69:1-36; Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; John 19:16-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear <i class="calibre6">it</i> after Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed <i class="calibre6">are</i> the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided <i class="calibre6">him</i>, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Death of Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 22:1-31; Matthew 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; John 19:28-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Burial of Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 53:9-12; Matthew 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>And, behold, <i class="calibre6">there was</i> a man named Joseph, a counseller; <i class="calibre6">and he was</i> a good man, and a just: 
<span class="reftext">51</span>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) <i class="calibre6">he was</i> of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>This <i class="calibre6">man</i> went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">53</span>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
<span class="reftext">54</span>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
<span class="reftext">55</span>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
<span class="reftext">56</span>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p></div></body></html>
