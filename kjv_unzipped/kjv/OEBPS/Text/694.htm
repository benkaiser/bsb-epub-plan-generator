Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, <i class="calibre6">and</i> brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, <i class="calibre6">and</i> brought to silence;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> baldness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> every beard cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives <i class="calibre6">shall flee</i> unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.</p></div></body></html>
