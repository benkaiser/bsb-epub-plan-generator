<span class="reftext">2</span>For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, <i class="calibre6">so that</i> all that hear will laugh with me. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born <i class="calibre6">him</i> a son in his old age.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the <i class="calibre6">same</i> day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sarah Turns against Hagar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, <i class="calibre6">even</i> with Isaac. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy seed. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto Hagar, putting <i class="calibre6">it</i> on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And she went, and sat her down over against <i class="calibre6">him</i> a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and lift up her voice, and wept. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he <i class="calibre6">is</i>. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Covenant at Beersheba</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God <i class="calibre6">is</i> with thee in all that thou doest: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: <i class="calibre6">but</i> according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Abraham said, I will swear. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I <i class="calibre6">of it</i>, but to day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What <i class="calibre6">mean</i> these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he said, For <i class="calibre6">these</i> seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And <i class="calibre6">Abraham</i> planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p></div></body></html>
