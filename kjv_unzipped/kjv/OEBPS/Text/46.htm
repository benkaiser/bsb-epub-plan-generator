<span class="reftext">2</span>And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he said, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up <i class="calibre6">again</i>: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</p>

<span class="reftext">29</span>And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> yet alive. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And the men <i class="calibre6">are</i> shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> your occupation? 
<span class="reftext">34</span>That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, <i class="calibre6">and</i> also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd <i class="calibre6">is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p></div></body></html>
