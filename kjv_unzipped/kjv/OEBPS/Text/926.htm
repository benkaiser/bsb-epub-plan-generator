<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <i class="calibre6">Was</i> not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Polluted Offerings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>A son honoureth <i class="calibre6">his</i> father, and a servant his master: if then I <i class="calibre6">be</i> a father, where <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine honour? and if I <i class="calibre6">be</i> a master, where <i class="calibre6">is</i> my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> contemptible. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is there</i> even among you that would shut the doors <i class="calibre6">for nought</i>? neither do ye kindle <i class="calibre6">fire</i> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <i class="calibre6">even</i> his meat, <i class="calibre6">is</i> contemptible. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness <i class="calibre6">is it</i>! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought <i class="calibre6">that which was</i> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But cursed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name <i class="calibre6">is</i> dreadful among the heathen.</p></div></body></html>
