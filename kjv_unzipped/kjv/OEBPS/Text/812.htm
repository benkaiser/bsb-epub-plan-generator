  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Glory Exits the Temple</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, <i class="calibre6">even</i> under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter <i class="calibre6">them</i> over the city. And he went in in my sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, <i class="calibre6">and stood</i> over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD'S glory. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And it came to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And <i class="calibre6">one</i> cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that <i class="calibre6">was</i> between the cherubims, and took <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> into the hands of <i class="calibre6">him that was</i> clothed with linen: who took <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and went out. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man's hand under their wings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <i class="calibre6">was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And <i class="calibre6">as for</i> their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <i class="calibre6">were</i> full of eyes round about, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the wheels that they four had. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And every one had four faces: the first face <i class="calibre6">was</i> the face of a cherub, and the second face <i class="calibre6">was</i> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the cherubims were lifted up. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>When they stood, <i class="calibre6">these</i> stood; and when they were lifted up, <i class="calibre6">these</i> lifted up themselves <i class="calibre6">also</i>: for the spirit of the living creature <i class="calibre6">was</i> in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <i class="calibre6">were</i> beside them, and <i class="calibre6">every one</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel <i class="calibre6">was</i> over them above.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they <i class="calibre6">were</i> the cherubims. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man <i class="calibre6">was</i> under their wings. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the likeness of their faces <i class="calibre6">was</i> the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward.</p></div></body></html>
