<p class="hdg">The Chief Levites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, <i class="calibre6">were</i> recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign of Darius the Persian. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, <i class="calibre6">were</i> written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise <i class="calibre6">and</i> to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, <i class="calibre6">were</i> porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>These <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.</p>
<p class="hdg">Dedication of the Wall</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, <i class="calibre6">with</i> cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi; 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great <i class="calibre6">companies of them that gave</i> thanks, <i class="calibre6">whereof one</i> went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And <i class="calibre6">certain</i> of the priests' sons with trumpets; <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And the other <i class="calibre6">company of them that gave</i> thanks went over against <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>So stood the two <i class="calibre6">companies of them that gave</i> thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Hananiah, with trumpets; 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah <i class="calibre6">their</i> overseer. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</p>
<p class="hdg">Provisions for Temple Worship</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, <i class="calibre6">and</i> of Solomon his son. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>For in the days of David and Asaph of old <i class="calibre6">there were</i> chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified <i class="calibre6">holy things</i> unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto the children of Aaron.</p></div></body></html>
