<span class="reftext">2</span>(After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;) 
<span class="reftext">3</span>By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Build ye houses, and dwell <i class="calibre6">in them</i>; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that <i class="calibre6">be</i> in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And ye shall seek me, and find <i class="calibre6">me</i>, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon; 
<span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">Know</i> that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, <i class="calibre6">and</i> of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending <i class="calibre6">them</i>; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which <i class="calibre6">are</i> in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and <i class="calibre6">am</i> a witness, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Shemaiah's Letter against Jeremiah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span><i class="calibre6">Thus</i> shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that <i class="calibre6">are</i> at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, 
<span class="reftext">26</span>The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man <i class="calibre6">that is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For therefore he sent unto us <i class="calibre6">in</i> Babylon, saying, This <i class="calibre6">captivity is</i> long: build ye houses, and dwell <i class="calibre6">in them</i>; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
