  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Saul Chosen as King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he had a son, whose name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward <i class="calibre6">he was</i> higher than any of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found <i class="calibre6">them</i> not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and <i class="calibre6">there they were</i> not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found <i class="calibre6">them</i> not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave <i class="calibre6">caring</i> for the asses, and take thought for us. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he said unto him, Behold now, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> in this city a man of God, and <i class="calibre6">he is</i> an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: <i class="calibre6">that</i> will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> now <i class="calibre6">called</i> a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God <i class="calibre6">was</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, <i class="calibre6">he is</i> before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; <i class="calibre6">and</i> afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they went up into the city: <i class="calibre6">and</i> when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him <i class="calibre6">to be</i> captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house <i class="calibre6">is</i>. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in thine heart. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom <i class="calibre6">is</i> all the desire of Israel? <i class="calibre6">Is it</i> not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Saul answered and said, <i class="calibre6">Am</i> not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which <i class="calibre6">were</i> about thirty persons. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the cook took up the shoulder, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> which <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon it, and set <i class="calibre6">it</i> before Saul. And <i class="calibre6">Samuel</i> said, Behold that which is left! set <i class="calibre6">it</i> before thee, <i class="calibre6">and</i> eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <i class="calibre6">Samuel</i> communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 
<span class="reftext">27</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p></div></body></html>
