  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Prayer for the Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>
<p class="hdg">Prayer for the Disciples</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <i class="calibre6">are</i>. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Prayer for all Believers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <i class="calibre6">art</i> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <i class="calibre6">it</i>: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</p></div></body></html>
