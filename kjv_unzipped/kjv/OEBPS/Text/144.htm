<span class="reftext">2</span>And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, <i class="calibre6">by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us <i class="calibre6">therefore</i> a possession among the brethren of our father. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Law of Inheritances</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>

<span class="reftext">13</span>And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.</p>

<span class="reftext">19</span>And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And thou shalt put <i class="calibre6">some</i> of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask <i class="calibre6">counsel</i> for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, <i class="calibre6">both</i> he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p></div></body></html>
