<span class="reftext">2</span>And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i class="calibre6">so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i class="calibre6">is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters <i class="calibre6">are</i> good and right; but <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no man <i class="calibre6">deputed</i> of the king to hear thee. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And it was <i class="calibre6">so</i>, that when any man came nigh <i class="calibre6">to him</i> to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i class="calibre6">that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, <i class="calibre6">even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Flees Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And David said unto all his servants that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i class="calibre6">else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i class="calibre6">are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, <i class="calibre6">which were</i> concubines, to keep the house. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a stranger, and also an exile. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Whereas thou camest <i class="calibre6">but</i> yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth <i class="calibre6">be</i> with thee. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Ittai answered the king, and said, <i class="calibre6">As</i> the LORD liveth, and <i class="calibre6">as</i> my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <i class="calibre6">both</i> it, and his habitation: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, <i class="calibre6">here am</i> I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i class="calibre6">Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Weeps at Mount Olivet</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And David went up by the ascent of <i class="calibre6">mount</i> Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And <i class="calibre6">one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i class="calibre6">is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And it came to pass, that <i class="calibre6">when</i> David was come to the top <i class="calibre6">of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 
<span class="reftext">34</span>But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i class="calibre6">as</i> I <i class="calibre6">have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto, so <i class="calibre6">will</i> I now also <i class="calibre6">be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And <i class="calibre6">hast thou</i> not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i> what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell <i class="calibre6">it</i> to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">they have</i> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's <i class="calibre6">son</i>, and Jonathan Abiathar's <i class="calibre6">son</i>; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</p></div></body></html>
