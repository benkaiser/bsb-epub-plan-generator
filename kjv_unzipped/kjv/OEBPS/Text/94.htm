<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD <i class="calibre6">concerning things</i> which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the priest shall put <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which <i class="calibre6">is at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the inwards, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the two kidneys, and the fat that <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon them, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done <i class="calibre6">somewhat against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD <i class="calibre6">concerning things</i> which should not be done, and are guilty; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the priest shall dip his finger <i class="calibre6">in some</i> of the blood, and sprinkle <i class="calibre6">it</i> seven times before the LORD, <i class="calibre6">even</i> before the vail. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he shall put <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the blood upon the horns of the altar which <i class="calibre6">is</i> before the LORD, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which <i class="calibre6">is at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the altar. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sin offering for the congregation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>When a ruler hath sinned, and done <i class="calibre6">somewhat</i> through ignorance <i class="calibre6">against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD his God <i class="calibre6">concerning things</i> which should not be done, and is guilty; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth <i class="calibre6">somewhat against</i> any of the commandments of the LORD <i class="calibre6">concerning things</i> which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.</p></div></body></html>
