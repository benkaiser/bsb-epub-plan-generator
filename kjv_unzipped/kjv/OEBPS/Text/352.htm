<span class="reftext">2</span>And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the names of <i class="calibre6">his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

And David heard <i class="calibre6">of it</i>, and went out against them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i class="calibre6">that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p></div></body></html>
