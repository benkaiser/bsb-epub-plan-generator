<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped <i class="calibre6">thine</i> hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Moab</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah <i class="calibre6">is</i> like unto all the heathen; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities <i class="calibre6">which are</i> on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Edom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against the Philistines</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy <i class="calibre6">it</i> for the old hatred; 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.</p></div></body></html>
