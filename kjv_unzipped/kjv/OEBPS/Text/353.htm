  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Preparations to Move the Ark to Jerusalem<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 6:12-15; Philippians 1:1-2; Colossians 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And <i class="calibre6">David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And said unto them, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i class="calibre6">both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto <i class="calibre6">the place that</i> I have prepared for it. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For because ye <i class="calibre6">did it</i> not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Priests and Levites Carry the Ark</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i class="calibre6">to be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And with them their brethren of the second <i class="calibre6">degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i class="calibre6">were appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i class="calibre6">was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i class="calibre6">was</i> skilful. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Berechiah and Elkanah <i class="calibre6">were</i> doorkeepers for the ark. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah <i class="calibre6">were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moving the Ark to Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And David <i class="calibre6">was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i class="calibre6">had</i> upon him an ephod of linen. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And it came to pass, <i class="calibre6">as</i> the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p></div></body></html>
