<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James <i class="calibre6">the son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James <i class="calibre6">the son</i> of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Ministry of the Twelve<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 6:7-13; Luke 9:1-6)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into <i class="calibre6">any</i> city of the Samaritans enter ye not: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Nor scrip for <i class="calibre6">your</i> journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when ye come into an house, salute it. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="hdg">Comfort in Persecution<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Timothy 1:6-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against <i class="calibre6">their</i> parents, and cause them to be put to death. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And ye shall be hated of all <i class="calibre6">men</i> for my name's sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>The disciple is not above <i class="calibre6">his</i> master, nor the servant above his lord. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more <i class="calibre6">shall they call</i> them of his household?</p>
<p class="hdg">Fearing God Alone<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 12:4-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>What I tell you in darkness, <i class="calibre6">that</i> speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, <i class="calibre6">that</i> preach ye upon the housetops. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p class="hdg">Confessing Christ<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 12:8-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Sword of the Gospel<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 12:49-53)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And a man's foes <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> they of his own household.</p>
<p class="hdg">Take up Your Cross<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 16:24-28; Mark 8:34-38; Luke 9:23-27)</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Reward of Service<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Kings 4:8-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold <i class="calibre6">water</i> only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p></div></body></html>
