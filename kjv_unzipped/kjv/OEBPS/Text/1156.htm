<span class="reftext">2</span>Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Neither as being lords over <i class="calibre6">God's</i> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="hdg">Cast Your Cares on Him</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all <i class="calibre6">of you</i> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</p>
<p class="hdg">Benediction and Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <i class="calibre6">you</i>. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>To him <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The <i class="calibre6">church that is</i> at Babylon, elected together with <i class="calibre6">you</i>, saluteth you; and <i class="calibre6">so doth</i> Marcus my son. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
