  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Ezekiel Eats the Scroll</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat <i class="calibre6">it</i>; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, <i class="calibre6">but</i> to the house of Israel; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel <i class="calibre6">are</i> impudent and hardhearted. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they <i class="calibre6">be</i> a rebellious house. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the glory of the LORD from his place. 
<span class="reftext">13</span><i class="calibre6">I heard</i> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Watchman for Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <i class="calibre6">man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Again, When a righteous <i class="calibre6">man</i> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <i class="calibre6">man</i>, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> a rebellious house. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> a rebellious house.</p></div></body></html>
