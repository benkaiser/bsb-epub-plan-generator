  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Delivers the Adulterous Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with <i class="calibre6">his</i> finger wrote on the ground, <i class="calibre6">as though he heard them not</i>. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And they which heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, being convicted by <i class="calibre6">their own</i> conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus the Light of the World<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 John 1:5-10)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am <i class="calibre6">he</i>, ye shall die in your sins. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even <i class="calibre6">the same</i> that I said unto you from the beginning. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am <i class="calibre6">he</i>, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Truth will Set You Free<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 John 1:4-6)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, <i class="calibre6">then</i> are ye my disciples indeed; 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: <i class="calibre6">but</i> the Son abideth ever. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, <i class="calibre6">even</i> God.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Children of the Devil</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Why do ye not understand my speech? <i class="calibre6">even</i> because ye cannot hear my word. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>Ye are of <i class="calibre6">your</i> father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And because I tell <i class="calibre6">you</i> the truth, ye believe me not. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? 
<span class="reftext">47</span>He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear <i class="calibre6">them</i> not, because ye are not of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Before Abraham Was, I Am</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? 
<span class="reftext">49</span>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. 
<span class="reftext">51</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. 
<span class="reftext">53</span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? 
<span class="reftext">54</span>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: 
<span class="reftext">55</span>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. 
<span class="reftext">56</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and was glad. 
<span class="reftext">57</span>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
<span class="reftext">58</span>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
<span class="reftext">59</span>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p></div></body></html>
