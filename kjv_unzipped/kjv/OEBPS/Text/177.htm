<span class="reftext">2</span>And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's <i class="calibre6">wife</i>. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And <i class="calibre6">if</i> the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth <i class="calibre6">it</i> in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her <i class="calibre6">to be</i> his wife; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that <i class="calibre6">is</i> abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> an inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business: <i class="calibre6">but</i> he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.</p>
<p class="hdg">Additional Laws</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he taketh <i class="calibre6">a man's</i> life to pledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, <i class="calibre6">so</i> ye shall observe to do. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if the man <i class="calibre6">be</i> poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant <i class="calibre6">that is</i> poor and needy, <i class="calibre6">whether he be</i> of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in thy land within thy gates: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>At his day thou shalt give <i class="calibre6">him</i> his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, <i class="calibre6">nor</i> of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean <i class="calibre6">it</i> afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.</p></div></body></html>
