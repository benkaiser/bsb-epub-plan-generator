  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Punishment Brings No Repentance</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And ye shall go out at the breaches, every <i class="calibre6">cow at that which is</i> before her; and ye shall cast <i class="calibre6">them</i> into the palace, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, <i class="calibre6">and</i> your tithes after three years:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim <i class="calibre6">and</i> publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And also I have withholden the rain from you, when <i class="calibre6">there were</i> yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>So two <i class="calibre6">or</i> three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured <i class="calibre6">them</i>: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I have overthrown <i class="calibre6">some</i> of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: <i class="calibre6">and</i> because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what <i class="calibre6">is</i> his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name.</p></div></body></html>
