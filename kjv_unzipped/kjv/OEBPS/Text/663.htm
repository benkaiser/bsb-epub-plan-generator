  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Evils of Oppression</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <i class="calibre6">such as were</i> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <i class="calibre6">there was</i> power; but they had no comforter. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Yea, better <i class="calibre6">is he</i> than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Better <i class="calibre6">is</i> an handful <i class="calibre6">with</i> quietness, than both the hands full <i class="calibre6">with</i> travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>There is one <i class="calibre6">alone</i>, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet <i class="calibre6">is there</i> no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither <i class="calibre6">saith he</i>, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This <i class="calibre6">is</i> also vanity, yea, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sore travail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Two <i class="calibre6">are</i> better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him <i class="calibre6">that is</i> alone when he falleth; for <i class="calibre6">he hath</i> not another to help him up. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm <i class="calibre6">alone</i>? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Futility of Power</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Better <i class="calibre6">is</i> a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> born in his kingdom becometh poor. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead. 
<span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> no end of all the people, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</p></div></body></html>
