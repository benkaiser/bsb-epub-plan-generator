<span class="reftext">2</span>And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the sons of Israel came to buy <i class="calibre6">corn</i> among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Joseph <i class="calibre6">was</i> the governor over the land, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he <i class="calibre6">it was</i> that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him <i class="calibre6">with</i> their faces to the earth. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>We <i class="calibre6">are</i> all one man's sons; we <i class="calibre6">are</i> true <i class="calibre6">men</i>, thy servants are no spies. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And they said, Thy servants <i class="calibre6">are</i> twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest <i class="calibre6">is</i> this day with our father, and one <i class="calibre6">is</i> not. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Joseph said unto them, That <i class="calibre6">is it</i> that I spake unto you, saying, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> spies: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether <i class="calibre6">there be any</i> truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> spies. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; <i class="calibre6">for</i> I fear God: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>If ye <i class="calibre6">be</i> true <i class="calibre6">men</i>, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And they said one to another, We <i class="calibre6">are</i> verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And they knew not that Joseph understood <i class="calibre6">them</i>; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph's Brothers Return to Canaan</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it <i class="calibre6">was</i> in his sack's mouth. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> even in my sack: and their heart failed <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> this <i class="calibre6">that</i> God hath done unto us?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>The man, <i class="calibre6">who is</i> the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And we said unto him, We <i class="calibre6">are</i> true <i class="calibre6">men</i>; we are no spies: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>We <i class="calibre6">be</i> twelve brethren, sons of our father; one <i class="calibre6">is</i> not, and the youngest <i class="calibre6">is</i> this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> true <i class="calibre6">men</i>; leave one of your brethren <i class="calibre6">here</i> with me, and take <i class="calibre6">food for</i> the famine of your households, and be gone: 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> no spies, but <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> true <i class="calibre6">men: so</i> will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money <i class="calibre6">was</i> in his sack: and when <i class="calibre6">both</i> they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved <i class="calibre6">of my children</i>: Joseph <i class="calibre6">is</i> not, and Simeon <i class="calibre6">is</i> not, and ye will take Benjamin <i class="calibre6">away</i>: all these things are against me. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p></div></body></html>
