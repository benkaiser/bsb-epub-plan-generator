  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Benjamin and the Silver Cup</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks <i class="calibre6">with</i> food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 
<span class="reftext">4</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> when they were gone out of the city, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not <i class="calibre6">yet</i> far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 
<span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not this <i class="calibre6">it</i> in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he said, Now also <i class="calibre6">let</i> it <i class="calibre6">be</i> according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he searched, <i class="calibre6">and</i> began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he <i class="calibre6">was</i> yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Joseph said unto them, What deed <i class="calibre6">is</i> this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we <i class="calibre6">are</i> my lord's servants, both we, and <i class="calibre6">he</i> also with whom the cup is found. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said, God forbid that I should do so: <i class="calibre6">but</i> the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>
<p class="hdg">Judah Pleads for Benjamin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> even as Pharaoh. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for <i class="calibre6">if</i> he should leave his father, <i class="calibre6">his father</i> would die. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And our father said, Go again, <i class="calibre6">and</i> buy us a little food. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother <i class="calibre6">be</i> with us. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two <i class="calibre6">sons</i>: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad <i class="calibre6">be</i> not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 
<span class="reftext">31</span>It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad <i class="calibre6">is</i> not <i class="calibre6">with us</i>, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad <i class="calibre6">be</i> not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p></div></body></html>
