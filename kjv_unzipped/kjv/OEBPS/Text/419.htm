<span class="reftext">2</span>That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in <i class="calibre6">some one of</i> the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Wherein <i class="calibre6">was</i> written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith <i class="calibre6">it, that</i> thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to these words. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, <i class="calibre6">There is</i> a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, <i class="calibre6">O God</i>, strengthen my hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who <i class="calibre6">was</i> shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who <i class="calibre6">is there</i>, that, <i class="calibre6">being</i> as I <i class="calibre6">am</i>, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore <i class="calibre6">was</i> he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> they might have <i class="calibre6">matter</i> for an evil report, that they might reproach me. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p>
<p class="hdg">Completion of the Wall</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth <i class="calibre6">day</i> of <i class="calibre6">the month</i> Elul, in fifty and two days. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>, and all the heathen that <i class="calibre6">were</i> about us saw <i class="calibre6">these things</i>, they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and <i class="calibre6">the letters</i> of Tobiah came unto them. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For <i class="calibre6">there were</i> many in Judah sworn unto him, because he <i class="calibre6">was</i> the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. <i class="calibre6">And</i> Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p></div></body></html>
