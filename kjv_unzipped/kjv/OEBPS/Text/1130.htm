<span class="reftext">2</span>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>To Titus, <i class="calibre6">mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="hdg">Appointment of Elders on Crete</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="hdg">Correcting False Teachers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>One of themselves, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i class="calibre6">are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Unto the pure all things <i class="calibre6">are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i class="calibre6">is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i class="calibre6">him</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p></div></body></html>
