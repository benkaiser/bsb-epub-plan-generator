  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Message to the Church in Ephesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Acts 19:8-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless I have <i class="calibre6">somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Message to the Church in Smyrna</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <i class="calibre6">I know</i> the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but <i class="calibre6">are</i> the synagogue of Satan. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast <i class="calibre6">some</i> of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
<p class="hdg">Message to the Church in Pergamum</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, <i class="calibre6">even</i> where Satan's seat <i class="calibre6">is</i>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas <i class="calibre6">was</i> my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Message to the Church in Thyatira<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Acts 16:11-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <i class="calibre6">are</i> like fine brass;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last <i class="calibre6">to be</i> more than the first. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But that which ye have <i class="calibre6">already</i> hold fast till I come. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And I will give him the morning star. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p></div></body></html>
