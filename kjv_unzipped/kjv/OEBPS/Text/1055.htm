  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Concern for the Jews</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who are Israelites; to whom <i class="calibre6">pertaineth</i> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <i class="calibre6">of God</i>, and the promises; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Whose <i class="calibre6">are</i> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <i class="calibre6">came</i>, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Sovereign Choice<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 25:19-28; Malachi 1:1-5)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <i class="calibre6">are</i> not all Israel, which are of Israel: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <i class="calibre6">are they</i> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <i class="calibre6">are</i> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And not only <i class="calibre6">this</i>; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <i class="calibre6">even</i> by our father Isaac; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>(For <i class="calibre6">the children</i> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) 
<span class="reftext">12</span>It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>What shall we say then? <i class="calibre6">Is there</i> unrighteousness with God? God forbid. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>So then <i class="calibre6">it is</i> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <i class="calibre6">have mercy</i>, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Calling of the Gentiles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <i class="calibre6">it</i>, Why hast thou made me thus? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour? 
<span class="reftext">22</span><i class="calibre6">What</i> if God, willing to shew <i class="calibre6">his</i> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For he will finish the work, and cut <i class="calibre6">it</i> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel's Unbelief</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Wherefore? Because <i class="calibre6">they sought it</i> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p></div></body></html>
