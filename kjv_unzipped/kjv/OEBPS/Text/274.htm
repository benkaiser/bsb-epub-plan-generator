  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">David Plans a Temple</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in thine heart; for the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> with thee.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Covenant with David<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Chronicles 17:1-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Whereas I have not dwelt in <i class="calibre6">any</i> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>In all <i class="calibre6">the places</i> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <i class="calibre6">men</i> that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the earth. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And as since the time that I commanded judges <i class="calibre6">to be</i> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <i class="calibre6">it</i> from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Prayer of Thanksgiving<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Chronicles 17:16-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who <i class="calibre6">am</i> I, O Lord GOD? and what <i class="calibre6">is</i> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And <i class="calibre6">is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none like thee, neither <i class="calibre6">is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And what one nation in the earth <i class="calibre6">is</i> like thy people, <i class="calibre6">even</i> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i class="calibre6">from</i> the nations and their gods? 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <i class="calibre6">to be</i> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish <i class="calibre6">it</i> for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And now, O Lord GOD, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p></div></body></html>
