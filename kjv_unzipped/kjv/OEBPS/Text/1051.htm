  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Faith Brings Peace and Joy<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 14:27-31)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And not only <i class="calibre6">so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And patience, experience; and experience, hope: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ's Sacrifice for the Ungodly<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 22:1-10; John 3:16-21)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And not only <i class="calibre6">so</i>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
<p class="hdg">Death in Adam, Life in Christ<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 3:1-7; Genesis 7:1-5; 2 Peter 3:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>But not as the offence, so also <i class="calibre6">is</i> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And not as <i class="calibre6">it was</i> by one that sinned, <i class="calibre6">so is</i> the gift: for the judgment <i class="calibre6">was</i> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <i class="calibre6">is</i> of many offences unto justification. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore as by the offence of one <i class="calibre6">judgment came</i> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <i class="calibre6">the free gift came</i> upon all men unto justification of life. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></div></body></html>
