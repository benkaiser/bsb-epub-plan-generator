  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Sing Aloud to God, Our Strength!</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician upon Gittith, <i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of Asaph. Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For this <i class="calibre6">was</i> a statute for Israel, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>This he ordained in Joseph <i class="calibre6">for</i> a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: <i class="calibre6">where</i> I heard a language <i class="calibre6">that</i> I understood not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: <i class="calibre6">and</i> they walked in their own counsels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Israel had walked in my ways!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p></div></body></html>
