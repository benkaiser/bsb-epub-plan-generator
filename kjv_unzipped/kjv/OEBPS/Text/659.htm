  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Words of King Lemuel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> not for kings, O Lemuel, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Virtues of Noble Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price <i class="calibre6">is</i> far above rubies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>She perceiveth that her merchandise <i class="calibre6">is</i> good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household <i class="calibre6">are</i> clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing <i class="calibre6">is</i> silk and purple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>She maketh fine linen, and selleth <i class="calibre6">it</i>; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Strength and honour <i class="calibre6">are</i> her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue <i class="calibre6">is</i> the law of kindness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband <i class="calibre6">also</i>, and he praiseth her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Favour <i class="calibre6">is</i> deceitful, and beauty <i class="calibre6">is</i> vain: <i class="calibre6">but</i> a woman <i class="calibre6">that</i> feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p></div></body></html>
