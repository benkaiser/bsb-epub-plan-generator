  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Judgment on Babylon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The word that the LORD spake against Babylon <i class="calibre6">and</i> against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, <i class="calibre6">and</i> conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</p>
<p class="hdg">Hope for Israel and Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <i class="calibre6">on</i> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Babylon's Fall is Certain</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</p>
<p class="hdg">Redemption for God's People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Israel <i class="calibre6">is</i> a scattered sheep; the lions have driven <i class="calibre6">him</i> away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and <i class="calibre6">there shall be</i> none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Destruction of Babylon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Go up against the land of Merathaim, <i class="calibre6">even</i> against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>A sound of battle <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the land, and of great destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, <i class="calibre6">O thou</i> most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will visit thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah <i class="calibre6">were</i> oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Their Redeemer <i class="calibre6">is</i> strong; the LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>A sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise <i class="calibre6">men</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>A sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>A sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>A drought <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the land of graven images, and they are mad upon <i class="calibre6">their</i> idols.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell <i class="calibre6">there</i>, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <i class="calibre6">cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD; <i class="calibre6">so</i> shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>They shall hold the bow and the lance: they <i class="calibre6">are</i> cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, <i class="calibre6">every one</i> put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, <i class="calibre6">and</i> pangs as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a chosen <i class="calibre6">man, that</i> I may appoint over her? for who <i class="calibre6">is</i> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> that shepherd that will stand before me? 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make <i class="calibre6">their</i> habitation desolate with them. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.</p></div></body></html>
