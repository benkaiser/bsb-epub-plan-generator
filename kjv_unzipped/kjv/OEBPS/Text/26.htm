  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Promise to Isaac<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 12:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
<p class="hdg">Isaac Deceives Abimelech</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the men of the place asked <i class="calibre6">him</i> of his wife; and he said, She <i class="calibre6">is</i> my sister: for he feared to say, <i class="calibre6">She is</i> my wife; lest, <i class="calibre6">said he</i>, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she <i class="calibre6">was</i> fair to look upon. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac <i class="calibre6">was</i> sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy wife: and how saidst thou, She <i class="calibre6">is</i> my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Abimelech said, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Abimelech charged all <i class="calibre6">his</i> people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="hdg">Isaac's Prosperity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water <i class="calibre6">is</i> ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.</p>
<p class="hdg">Isaac's Covenant with Abimelech</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, <i class="calibre6">even</i> betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 
<span class="reftext">29</span>That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> now the blessed of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city <i class="calibre6">is</i> Beersheba unto this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Esau's Wives</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p></div></body></html>
