<span class="reftext">2</span>Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about him that is slain: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the city <i class="calibre6">which is</i> next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, <i class="calibre6">and</i> which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be <i class="calibre6">tried</i>: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And all the elders of that city, <i class="calibre6">that are</i> next unto the slain <i class="calibre6">man</i>, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>So shalt thou put away the <i class="calibre6">guilt of</i> innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do <i class="calibre6">that which is</i> right in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Marrying a Captive Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.</p>
<p class="hdg">Inheritance Rights of the Firstborn</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, <i class="calibre6">both</i> the beloved and the hated; and <i class="calibre6">if</i> the firstborn son be hers that was hated: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit <i class="calibre6">that</i> which he hath, <i class="calibre6">that</i> he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, <i class="calibre6">which is indeed</i> the firstborn: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated <i class="calibre6">for</i> the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn <i class="calibre6">is</i> his.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Rebellious Son<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 15:11-32)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and <i class="calibre6">that</i>, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son <i class="calibre6">is</i> stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; <i class="calibre6">he is</i> a glutton, and a drunkard. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>
<p class="hdg">Cursed is Anyone Hung on a Tree<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Galatians 3:10-14)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged <i class="calibre6">is</i> accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> an inheritance.</p></div></body></html>
