  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Song of Trust in God's Provision</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will <i class="calibre6">God</i> appoint <i class="calibre6">for</i> walls and bulwarks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Thou wilt keep <i class="calibre6">him</i> in perfect peace, <i class="calibre6">whose</i> mind <i class="calibre6">is</i> stayed <i class="calibre6">on thee</i>: because he trusteth in thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH <i class="calibre6">is</i> everlasting strength:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the ground; he bringeth it <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The foot shall tread it down, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the feet of the poor, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the steps of the needy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The way of the just <i class="calibre6">is</i> uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of <i class="calibre6">our</i> soul <i class="calibre6">is</i> to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Let favour be shewed to the wicked, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>LORD, <i class="calibre6">when</i> thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: <i class="calibre6">but</i> they shall see, and be ashamed for <i class="calibre6">their</i> envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>O LORD our God, <i class="calibre6">other</i> lords beside thee have had dominion over us: <i class="calibre6">but</i> by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span><i class="calibre6">They are</i> dead, they shall not live; <i class="calibre6">they are</i> deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed <i class="calibre6">it</i> far <i class="calibre6">unto</i> all the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer <i class="calibre6">when</i> thy chastening <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Like as a woman with child, <i class="calibre6">that</i> draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, <i class="calibre6">and</i> crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Thy dead <i class="calibre6">men</i> shall live, <i class="calibre6">together with</i> my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew <i class="calibre6">is as</i> the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</p></div></body></html>
