  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Tradition and Vain Worship<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 7:1-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to <i class="calibre6">his</i> father or <i class="calibre6">his</i> mother, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And honour not his father or his mother, <i class="calibre6">he shall be free</i>. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. 
<span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Ye</i> hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with <i class="calibre6">their</i> lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But in vain they do worship me, teaching <i class="calibre6">for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="hdg">What Defiles a Man<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 7:14-23)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>These are <i class="calibre6">the things</i> which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of the Canaanite Woman<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 7:24-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, <i class="calibre6">thou</i> Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i class="calibre6">it</i> to dogs. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Feeding of the Four Thousand<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 8:1-10)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them <i class="calibre6">those that were</i> lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them: 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then Jesus called his disciples <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i class="calibre6">meat</i> that was left seven baskets full. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</p></div></body></html>
