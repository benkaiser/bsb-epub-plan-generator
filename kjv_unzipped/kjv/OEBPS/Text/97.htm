<span class="reftext">18</span>And if <i class="calibre6">any</i> of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And the flesh that toucheth any unclean <i class="calibre6">thing</i> shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof.

<p class="hdg">The Priests' Portion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<span class="reftext">30</span>His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved <i class="calibre6">for</i> a wave offering before the LORD.
