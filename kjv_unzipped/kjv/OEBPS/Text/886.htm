  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Locusts, Fire, and Plumbline<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Joel 2:1-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, <i class="calibre6">it was</i> the latter growth after the king's mowings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And it came to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> small.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> small.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i class="calibre6">made</i> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="hdg">Amaziah Accuses Amos</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the king's chapel, and it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the king's court.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <i class="calibre6">was</i> no prophet, neither <i class="calibre6">was</i> I a prophet's son; but I <i class="calibre6">was</i> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not <i class="calibre6">thy word</i> against the house of Isaac. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p></div></body></html>
