  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Parable of the Persistent Widow</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And he spake a parable unto them <i class="calibre6">to this end</i>, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pharisee and Tax Collector</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men <i class="calibre6">are</i>, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as <i class="calibre6">his</i> eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified <i class="calibre6">rather</i> than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Blesses the Children<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 19:13-15; Mark 10:13-16)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when <i class="calibre6">his</i> disciples saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, they rebuked them. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But Jesus called them <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Rich Young Ruler<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 19:16-30; Mark 10:17-31)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none <i class="calibre6">is</i> good, save one, <i class="calibre6">that is</i>, God. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they that heard <i class="calibre6">it</i> said, Who then can be saved? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Again Predicts His Death<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 9:43-45)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then he took <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And they shall scourge <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 20:29-34; Mark 10:46-52)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he cried, saying, Jesus, <i class="calibre6">thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, <i class="calibre6">Thou</i> Son of David, have mercy on me. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
<span class="reftext">41</span>Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, gave praise unto God.</p></div></body></html>
