  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Hear My Teaching, My People<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 13:34-35)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, <i class="calibre6">to</i> my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>We will not hide <i class="calibre6">them</i> from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>That the generation to come might know <i class="calibre6">them, even</i> the children <i class="calibre6">which</i> should be born; <i class="calibre6">who</i> should arise and declare <i class="calibre6">them</i> to their children:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation <i class="calibre6">that</i> set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The children of Ephraim, <i class="calibre6">being</i> armed, <i class="calibre6">and</i> carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, <i class="calibre6">in</i> the field of Zoan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave <i class="calibre6">them</i> drink as <i class="calibre6">out of</i> the great depths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore the LORD heard <i class="calibre6">this</i>, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And he let <i class="calibre6">it</i> fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat <i class="calibre6">was</i> yet in their mouths,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen <i class="calibre6">men</i> of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And they remembered that God <i class="calibre6">was</i> their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>But he, <i class="calibre6">being</i> full of compassion, forgave <i class="calibre6">their</i> iniquity, and destroyed <i class="calibre6">them</i> not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>For he remembered that they <i class="calibre6">were but</i> flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> grieve him in the desert!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>They remembered not his hand, <i class="calibre6">nor</i> the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">49</span>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels <i class="calibre6">among them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">51</span>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of <i class="calibre6">their</i> strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">52</span>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">53</span>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">54</span>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, <i class="calibre6">even to</i> this mountain, <i class="calibre6">which</i> his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">55</span>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">56</span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">57</span>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">58</span>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">59</span>When God heard <i class="calibre6">this</i>, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">60</span>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent <i class="calibre6">which</i> he placed among men;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">61</span>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">62</span>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">63</span>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">64</span>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">65</span>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, <i class="calibre6">and</i> like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">66</span>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">67</span>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">68</span>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">69</span>And he built his sanctuary like high <i class="calibre6">palaces</i>, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">70</span>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">71</span>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">72</span>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p></div></body></html>
