  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord Answers Again</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i class="calibre6">it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the vision <i class="calibre6">is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, his soul <i class="calibre6">which</i> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i class="calibre6">he is</i> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <i class="calibre6">is</i> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</p>
<p class="hdg">Woe to the Chaldeans</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <i class="calibre6">that which is</i> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <i class="calibre6">against</i> thy soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and makest <i class="calibre6">him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD'S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> on thy glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i class="calibre6">which</i> made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> laid over with gold and silver, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p></div></body></html>
