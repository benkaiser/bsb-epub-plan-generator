And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <i class="calibre6">certain</i> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province <i class="calibre6">are</i> in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also <i class="calibre6">is</i> broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned <i class="calibre6">certain</i> days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, <i class="calibre6">If</i> ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But <i class="calibre6">if</i> ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Now these <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p></div></body></html>
