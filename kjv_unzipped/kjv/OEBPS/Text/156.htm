  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">King Og Defeated</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>All these cities <i class="calibre6">were</i> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <i class="calibre6">was</i> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>(<i class="calibre6">Which</i> Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 
<span class="reftext">10</span>All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead <i class="calibre6">was</i> a bedstead of iron; <i class="calibre6">is</i> it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits <i class="calibre6">was</i> the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</p>
<p class="hdg">Division of the Land<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Numbers 32:1-5)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And this land, <i class="calibre6">which</i> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <i class="calibre6">being</i> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> the border of the children of Ammon; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all <i class="calibre6">that are</i> meet for the war. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (<i class="calibre6">for</i> I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and <i class="calibre6">until</i> they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and <i class="calibre6">then</i> shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Numbers 27:12-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God <i class="calibre6">is there</i> in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that <i class="calibre6">is</i> beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <i class="calibre6">it</i> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.</p></div></body></html>
