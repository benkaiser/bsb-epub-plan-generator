<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with the sound of the trumpet:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in unto the <i class="calibre6">same</i> maid, to profane my holy name:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And they lay <i class="calibre6">themselves</i> down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned <i class="calibre6">in</i> the house of their god.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Ingratitude of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height <i class="calibre6">was</i> like the height of the cedars, and he <i class="calibre6">was</i> strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. <i class="calibre6">Is it</i> not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed <i class="calibre6">that is</i> full of sheaves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> swift of foot shall not deliver <i class="calibre6">himself</i>: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
