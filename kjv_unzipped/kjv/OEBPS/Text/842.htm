<span class="reftext">2</span>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which <i class="calibre6">was</i> as the frame of a city on the south. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he brought me thither, and, behold, <i class="calibre6">there was</i> a man, whose appearance <i class="calibre6">was</i> like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto thee <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">The East Gate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits <i class="calibre6">long</i> by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <i class="calibre6">which was</i> one reed broad; and the other threshold <i class="calibre6">of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And <i class="calibre6">every</i> little chamber <i class="calibre6">was</i> one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within <i class="calibre6">was</i> one reed. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate <i class="calibre6">was</i> inward. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the little chambers of the gate eastward <i class="calibre6">were</i> three on this side, and three on that side; they three <i class="calibre6">were</i> of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; <i class="calibre6">and</i> the length of the gate, thirteen cubits. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The space also before the little chambers <i class="calibre6">was</i> one cubit <i class="calibre6">on this side</i>, and the space <i class="calibre6">was</i> one cubit on that side: and the little chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>He measured then the gate from the roof of <i class="calibre6">one</i> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <i class="calibre6">was</i> five and twenty cubits, door against door. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate <i class="calibre6">were</i> fifty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And <i class="calibre6">there were</i> narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows <i class="calibre6">were</i> round about inward: and upon <i class="calibre6">each</i> post <i class="calibre6">were</i> palm trees.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Outer Court</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <i class="calibre6">there were</i> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> upon the pavement. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates <i class="calibre6">was</i> the lower pavement. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.</p>
<p class="hdg">The North Gate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the little chambers thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, <i class="calibre6">were</i> after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> before them. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the gate of the inner court <i class="calibre6">was</i> over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.</p>
<p class="hdg">The South Gate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And <i class="calibre6">there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And <i class="calibre6">there were</i> seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And <i class="calibre6">there was</i> a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Gates of the Inner Court</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures; 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and <i class="calibre6">there were</i> windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: <i class="calibre6">it was</i> fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the arches round about <i class="calibre6">were</i> five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And the arches thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> toward the utter court; and palm trees <i class="calibre6">were</i> upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it <i class="calibre6">had</i> eight steps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, <i class="calibre6">were</i> according to these measures: and <i class="calibre6">there were</i> windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: <i class="calibre6">it was</i> fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And the arches thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> toward the outward court; and palm trees <i class="calibre6">were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <i class="calibre6">had</i> eight steps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And he brought me to the north gate, and measured <i class="calibre6">it</i> according to these measures; 
<span class="reftext">36</span>The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And the posts thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> toward the utter court; and palm trees <i class="calibre6">were</i> upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it <i class="calibre6">had</i> eight steps.</p>
<p class="hdg">Eight Tables for Sacrifices</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And the chambers and the entries thereof <i class="calibre6">were</i> by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And in the porch of the gate <i class="calibre6">were</i> two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, <i class="calibre6">were</i> two tables; and on the other side, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> at the porch of the gate, <i class="calibre6">were</i> two tables. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>Four tables <i class="calibre6">were</i> on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew <i class="calibre6">their sacrifices</i>. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And the four tables <i class="calibre6">were</i> of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And within <i class="calibre6">were</i> hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables <i class="calibre6">was</i> the flesh of the offering.</p>
<p class="hdg">Rooms for the Priests</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And without the inner gate <i class="calibre6">were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <i class="calibre6">was</i> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <i class="calibre6">having</i> the prospect toward the north. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect <i class="calibre6">is</i> toward the south, <i class="calibre6">is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And the chamber whose prospect <i class="calibre6">is</i> toward the north <i class="calibre6">is</i> for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Inner Courtyard</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar <i class="calibre6">that was</i> before the house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured <i class="calibre6">each</i> post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate <i class="calibre6">was</i> three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>The length of the porch <i class="calibre6">was</i> twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and <i class="calibre6">he brought me</i> by the steps whereby they went up to it: and <i class="calibre6">there were</i> pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</p></div></body></html>
