But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i class="calibre6">there were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he brought out the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in it, and cut <i class="calibre6">them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
