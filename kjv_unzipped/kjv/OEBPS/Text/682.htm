  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment against Judah and Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counseller, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And I will give children <i class="calibre6">to be</i> their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and <i class="calibre6">let</i> this ruin <i class="calibre6">be</i> under thy hand:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house <i class="calibre6">is</i> neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings <i class="calibre6">are</i> against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide <i class="calibre6">it</i> not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Say ye to the righteous, that <i class="calibre6">it shall be</i> well <i class="calibre6">with him</i>: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Woe unto the wicked! <i class="calibre6">it shall be</i> ill <i class="calibre6">with him</i>: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> my people, children <i class="calibre6">are</i> their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause <i class="calibre6">thee</i> to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor <i class="calibre6">is</i> in your houses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>What mean ye <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing <i class="calibre6">as</i> they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of <i class="calibre6">their</i> tinkling ornaments <i class="calibre6">about their feet</i>, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> cauls, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> round tires like the moon, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>The rings, and nose jewels, 
<span class="reftext">22</span>The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; <i class="calibre6">and</i> burning instead of beauty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she <i class="calibre6">being</i> desolate shall sit upon the ground.</p></div></body></html>
