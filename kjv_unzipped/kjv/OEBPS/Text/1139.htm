  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Call to Maturity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And this will we do, if God permit. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For <i class="calibre6">it is</i> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, 
<span class="reftext">6</span>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put <i class="calibre6">him</i> to an open shame. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But that which beareth thorns and briers <i class="calibre6">is</i> rejected, and <i class="calibre6">is</i> nigh unto cursing; whose end <i class="calibre6">is</i> to be burned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For God <i class="calibre6">is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Promise is Certain</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation <i class="calibre6">is</i> to them an end of all strife. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed <i class="calibre6">it</i> by an oath: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>That by two immutable things, in which <i class="calibre6">it was</i> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Which <i class="calibre6">hope</i> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <i class="calibre6">even</i> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p></div></body></html>
