<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses <i class="calibre6">was</i> very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that <i class="calibre6">is</i> behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</p></div></body></html>
