  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment against Nineveh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Woe to the bloody city! it <i class="calibre6">is</i> all full of lies <i class="calibre6">and</i> robbery; the prey departeth not;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear: and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases; and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none end of <i class="calibre6">their</i> corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, <i class="calibre6">that had</i> the waters round about it, whose rampart <i class="calibre6">was</i> the sea, <i class="calibre6">and</i> her wall <i class="calibre6">was</i> from the sea?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Ethiopia and Egypt <i class="calibre6">were</i> her strength, and <i class="calibre6">it was</i> infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Yet <i class="calibre6">was</i> she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>All thy strong holds <i class="calibre6">shall be like</i> fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, thy people in the midst of thee <i class="calibre6">are</i> women: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thy crowned <i class="calibre6">are</i> as the locusts, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, <i class="calibre6">but</i> when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they <i class="calibre6">are</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell <i class="calibre6">in the dust</i>: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</p></div></body></html>
