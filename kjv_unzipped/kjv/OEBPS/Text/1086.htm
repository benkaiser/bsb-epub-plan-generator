  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Generosity Commended</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For to <i class="calibre6">their</i> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <i class="calibre6">their</i> power <i class="calibre6">they were</i> willing of themselves; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <i class="calibre6">take upon us</i> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And <i class="calibre6">this they did</i>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore, as ye abound in every <i class="calibre6">thing, in</i> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> all diligence, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> your love to us, <i class="calibre6">see</i> that ye abound in this grace also. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ's Example</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And herein I give <i class="calibre6">my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now therefore perform the doing <i class="calibre6">of it</i>; that as <i class="calibre6">there was</i> a readiness to will, so <i class="calibre6">there may be</i> a performance also out of that which ye have. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For if there be first a willing mind, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> accepted according to that a man hath, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not according to that he hath not. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For <i class="calibre6">I mean</i> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But by an equality, <i class="calibre6">that</i> now at this time your abundance <i class="calibre6">may be a supply</i> for their want, that their abundance also may be <i class="calibre6">a supply</i> for your want: that there may be equality: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>As it is written, He that <i class="calibre6">had gathered</i> much had nothing over; and he that <i class="calibre6">had gathered</i> little had no lack.</p>
<p class="hdg">Titus Commended<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Titus 1:1-4)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>But thanks <i class="calibre6">be</i> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And not <i class="calibre6">that</i> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <i class="calibre6">declaration of</i> your ready mind: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <i class="calibre6">I have</i> in you. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Whether <i class="calibre6">any do inquire</i> of Titus, <i class="calibre6">he is</i> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <i class="calibre6">be inquired of, they are</i> the messengers of the churches, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the glory of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.</p></div></body></html>
