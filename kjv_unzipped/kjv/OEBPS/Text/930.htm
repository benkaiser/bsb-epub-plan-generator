<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her <i class="calibre6">that had been the wife</i> of Urias;

<span class="reftext">19</span>Then Joseph her husband, being a just <i class="calibre6">man</i>, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</p></div></body></html>
