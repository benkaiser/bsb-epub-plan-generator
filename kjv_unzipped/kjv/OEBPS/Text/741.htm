<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For <i class="calibre6">as</i> a young man marrieth a virgin, <i class="calibre6">so</i> shall thy sons marry thee: and <i class="calibre6">as</i> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, <i class="calibre6">so</i> shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn <i class="calibre6">to be</i> meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward <i class="calibre6">is</i> with him, and his work before him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.</p></div></body></html>
