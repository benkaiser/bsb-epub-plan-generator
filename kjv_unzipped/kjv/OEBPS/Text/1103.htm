  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Children and Parents<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 6:20-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) 
<span class="reftext">3</span>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<p class="hdg">Slaves and Masters<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Timothy 6:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Servants, be obedient to them that are <i class="calibre6">your</i> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether <i class="calibre6">he be</i> bond or free.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Full Armor of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i class="calibre6">places</i>. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>
<p class="hdg">Pray Continually</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But that ye also may know my affairs, <i class="calibre6">and</i> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things: 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> he might comfort your hearts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
