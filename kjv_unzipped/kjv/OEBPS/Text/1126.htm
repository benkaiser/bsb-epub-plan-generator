  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Greeting to Timothy<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Timothy 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>To Timothy, <i class="calibre6">my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="hdg">Encouragement to Be Faithful</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I thank God, whom I serve from <i class="calibre6">my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="hdg">Patience in Persecution<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 10:16-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Who hath saved us, and called <i class="calibre6">us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Hold to Sound Teaching</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i class="calibre6">me</i>. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p></div></body></html>
