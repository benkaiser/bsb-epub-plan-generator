<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? <i class="calibre6">who</i> among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> about him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>O LORD God of hosts, who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The heavens <i class="calibre6">are</i> thine, the earth also <i class="calibre6">is</i> thine: <i class="calibre6">as for</i> the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, <i class="calibre6">and</i> high is thy right hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Justice and judgment <i class="calibre6">are</i> the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> our defence; and the Holy One of Israel <i class="calibre6">is</i> our king.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon <i class="calibre6">one that is</i> mighty; I have exalted <i class="calibre6">one</i> chosen out of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>But my faithfulness and my mercy <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>He shall cry unto me, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Also I will make him <i class="calibre6">my</i> firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>His seed also will I make <i class="calibre6">to endure</i> for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>It shall be established for ever as the moon, and <i class="calibre6">as</i> a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown <i class="calibre6">by casting it</i> to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>What man <i class="calibre6">is he that</i> liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">49</span>Lord, where <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy former lovingkindnesses, <i class="calibre6">which</i> thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; <i class="calibre6">how</i> I do bear in my bosom <i class="calibre6">the reproach of</i> all the mighty people;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">51</span>Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">52</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p></div></body></html>
