  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Song of the Slandered</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For my love they are my adversaries: but I <i class="calibre6">give myself unto</i> prayer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Let his days be few; <i class="calibre6">and</i> let another take his office.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek <i class="calibre6">their bread</i> also out of their desolate places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Let his posterity be cut off; <i class="calibre6">and</i> in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Let it be unto him as the garment <i class="calibre6">which</i> covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span><i class="calibre6">Let</i> this <i class="calibre6">be</i> the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy <i class="calibre6">is</i> good, deliver thou me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I <i class="calibre6">am</i> poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I became also a reproach unto them: <i class="calibre6">when</i> they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>That they may know that this <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy hand; <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou, LORD, hast done it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save <i class="calibre6">him</i> from those that condemn his soul.</p></div></body></html>
