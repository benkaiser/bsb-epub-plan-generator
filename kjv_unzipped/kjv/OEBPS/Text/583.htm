<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>He <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD our God: his judgments <i class="calibre6">are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word <i class="calibre6">which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Which <i class="calibre6">covenant</i> he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to Israel <i class="calibre6">for</i> an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>When they were <i class="calibre6">but</i> a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>When they went from one nation to another, from <i class="calibre6">one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span><i class="calibre6">Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>He sent a man before them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> Joseph, <i class="calibre6">who</i> was sold for a servant:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The king sent and loosed him; <i class="calibre6">even</i> the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>He sent Moses his servant; <i class="calibre6">and</i> Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, <i class="calibre6">and</i> lice in all their coasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>He gave them hail for rain, <i class="calibre6">and</i> flaming fire in their land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> not one feeble <i class="calibre6">person</i> among their tribes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span><i class="calibre6">The people</i> asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places <i class="calibre6">like</i> a river.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>For he remembered his holy promise, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Abraham his servant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>And he brought forth his people with joy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> his chosen with gladness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
