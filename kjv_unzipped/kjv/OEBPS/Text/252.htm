  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Samuel Anoints David as King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me <i class="calibre6">him</i> whom I name unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed <i class="calibre6">is</i> before him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i class="calibre6">the LORD seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all <i class="calibre6">thy</i> children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And he sent, and brought him in. Now he <i class="calibre6">was</i> ruddy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this <i class="calibre6">is</i> he. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Serves Saul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let our lord now command thy servants, <i class="calibre6">which are</i> before thee, to seek out a man, <i class="calibre6">who is</i> a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring <i class="calibre6">him</i> to me. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, <i class="calibre6">that is</i> cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> with the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Jesse took an ass <i class="calibre6">laden</i> with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent <i class="calibre6">them</i> by David his son unto Saul. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And it came to pass, when the <i class="calibre6">evil</i> spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</p></div></body></html>
