<span class="reftext">2</span>And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For the LORD your God <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man <i class="calibre6">is there</i> that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And what man <i class="calibre6">is he</i> that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not <i class="calibre6">yet</i> eaten of it? let him <i class="calibre6">also</i> go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And what man <i class="calibre6">is there</i> that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man <i class="calibre6">is there that is</i> fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i> all the people <i class="calibre6">that is</i> found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities <i class="calibre6">which are</i> very far off from thee, which <i class="calibre6">are</i> not of the cities of these nations. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But thou shalt utterly destroy them; <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field <i class="calibre6">is</i> man's <i class="calibre6">life</i>) to employ <i class="calibre6">them</i> in the siege: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Only the trees which thou knowest that they <i class="calibre6">be</i> not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.</p></div></body></html>
