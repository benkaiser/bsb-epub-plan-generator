  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Melchizedek and Abraham<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 14:17-24)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Now consider how great this man <i class="calibre6">was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i class="calibre6">receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus a Priest Like Melchizedek</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i class="calibre6">was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For <i class="calibre6">it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For he testifieth, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i class="calibre6">did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And inasmuch as not without an oath <i class="calibre6">he was made priest</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But this <i class="calibre6">man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For such an high priest became us, <i class="calibre6">who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i class="calibre6">maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p></div></body></html>
