<span class="reftext">2</span>And five of them were wise, and five <i class="calibre6">were</i> foolish. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>They that <i class="calibre6">were</i> foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But the wise answered, saying, <i class="calibre6">Not so</i>; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Talents<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 19:11-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For <i class="calibre6">the kingdom of heaven is</i> as a man travelling into a far country, <i class="calibre6">who</i> called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made <i class="calibre6">them</i> other five talents. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And likewise he that <i class="calibre6">had received</i> two, he also gained other two. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, <i class="calibre6">thou</i> good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, <i class="calibre6">there</i> thou hast <i class="calibre6">that is</i> thine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>His lord answered and said unto him, <i class="calibre6">Thou</i> wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and <i class="calibre6">then</i> at my coming I should have received mine own with usury. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Take therefore the talent from him, and give <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto him which hath ten talents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Sheep and the Goats</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i class="calibre6">his</i> sheep from the goats: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
<span class="reftext">35</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in: 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i class="calibre6">thee</i>? or thirsty, and gave <i class="calibre6">thee</i> drink? 
<span class="reftext">38</span>When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i class="calibre6">thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i class="calibre6">thee</i>? 
<span class="reftext">39</span>Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: 
<span class="reftext">42</span>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 
<span class="reftext">43</span>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i class="calibre6">it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i class="calibre6">it</i> not to me. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p></div></body></html>
