<span class="reftext">2</span>For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Grace be with you, mercy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="hdg">Walking in the Truth<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 8:31-41)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p class="hdg">Beware of Deceivers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <i class="calibre6">your</i> house, neither bid him God speed: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Having many things to write unto you, I would not <i class="calibre6">write</i> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
