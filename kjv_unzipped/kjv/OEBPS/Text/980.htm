<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Raises a Widow's Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare <i class="calibre6">him</i> stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p class="hdg">John's Inquiry<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 11:1-6)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And John calling <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> two of his disciples sent <i class="calibre6">them</i> to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And in that same hour he cured many of <i class="calibre6">their</i> infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many <i class="calibre6">that were</i> blind he gave sight. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And blessed is <i class="calibre6">he</i>, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Testifies about John<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 11:7-19; Luke 1:5-25; Luke 16:14-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>This is <i class="calibre6">he</i>, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And all the people that heard <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? 
<span class="reftext">32</span>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
<span class="reftext">35</span>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Sinful Woman Anoints Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that <i class="calibre6">Jesus</i> sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And stood at his feet behind <i class="calibre6">him</i> weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe <i class="calibre6">them</i> with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed <i class="calibre6">them</i> with the ointment. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman <i class="calibre6">this is</i> that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Two Debtors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Simon answered and said, I suppose that <i class="calibre6">he</i>, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped <i class="calibre6">them</i> with the hairs of her head. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, <i class="calibre6">the same</i> loveth little. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p></div></body></html>
