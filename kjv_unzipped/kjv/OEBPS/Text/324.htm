<span class="reftext">5</span>And he commanded them, saying, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

<span class="reftext">8</span>And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all <i class="calibre6">things</i> that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the temple of the LORD.

<span class="reftext">15</span>But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.
