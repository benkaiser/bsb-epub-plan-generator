  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus and the Samaritan Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
<span class="reftext">3</span>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he must needs go through Samaria. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with <i class="calibre6">his</i> journey, sat thus on the well: <i class="calibre6">and</i> it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>God <i class="calibre6">is</i> a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship <i class="calibre6">him</i> in spirit and in truth. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am <i class="calibre6">he</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Disciples Return and Marvel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him <i class="calibre6">ought</i> to eat? 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and <i class="calibre6">then</i> cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
<p class="hdg">Many Samaritans Believe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And many more believed because of his own word; 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard <i class="calibre6">him</i> ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals the Official's Son<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 8:5-13; Luke 7:1-10)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
<span class="reftext">50</span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
<span class="reftext">51</span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told <i class="calibre6">him</i>, saying, Thy son liveth. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
<span class="reftext">53</span>So the father knew that <i class="calibre6">it was</i> at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. 
<span class="reftext">54</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> again the second miracle <i class="calibre6">that</i> Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p></div></body></html>
