<span class="reftext">2</span>And these <i class="calibre6">were</i> the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar <i class="calibre6">were</i> the priests: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Azariah the son of Nathan <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan <i class="calibre6">was</i> principal officer, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the king's friend: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Ahishar <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the tribute.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon's Twelve Officers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And these <i class="calibre6">are</i> their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him <i class="calibre6">pertained</i> Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Baana the son of Ahilud; <i class="calibre6">to him pertained</i> Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto <i class="calibre6">the place that is</i> beyond Jokneam: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him <i class="calibre6">pertained</i> the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which <i class="calibre6">are</i> in Gilead; to him <i class="calibre6">also pertained</i> the region of Argob, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Ahinadab the son of Iddo <i class="calibre6">had</i> Mahanaim: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Ahimaaz <i class="calibre6">was</i> in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Baanah the son of Hushai <i class="calibre6">was</i> in Asher and in Aloth: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Geber the son of Uri <i class="calibre6">was</i> in the country of Gilead, <i class="calibre6">in</i> the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and <i class="calibre6">he was</i> the only officer which <i class="calibre6">was</i> in the land.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon's Wealth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Judah and Israel <i class="calibre6">were</i> many, as the sand which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For he had dominion over all <i class="calibre6">the region</i> on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where <i class="calibre6">the officers</i> were, every man according to his charge.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon's Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the sea shore. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p></div></body></html>
