  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord is Exalted</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou <i class="calibre6">wast</i> not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; <i class="calibre6">and</i> when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And your spoil shall be gathered <i class="calibre6">like</i> the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, <i class="calibre6">and</i> strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> his treasure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The earth mourneth <i class="calibre6">and</i> languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed <i class="calibre6">and</i> hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off <i class="calibre6">their fruits</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, <i class="calibre6">as</i> fire, shall devour you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the people shall be <i class="calibre6">as</i> the burnings of lime: <i class="calibre6">as</i> thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Hear, ye <i class="calibre6">that are</i> far off, what I have done; and, ye <i class="calibre6">that are</i> near, acknowledge my might.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He shall dwell on high: his place of defence <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> sure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the scribe? where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the receiver? where <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that counted the towers?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, <i class="calibre6">that thou canst</i> not understand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But there the glorious LORD <i class="calibre6">will be</i> unto us a place of broad rivers <i class="calibre6">and</i> streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> our judge, the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> our lawgiver, the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> our king; he will save us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> forgiven <i class="calibre6">their</i> iniquity.</p></div></body></html>
