<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought <i class="calibre6">them</i> down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>He hath cut off in <i class="calibre6">his</i> fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, <i class="calibre6">which</i> devoureth round about.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all <i class="calibre6">that were</i> pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as <i class="calibre6">if it were of</i> a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes <i class="calibre6">are</i> among the Gentiles: the law <i class="calibre6">is</i> no <i class="calibre6">more</i>; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, <i class="calibre6">and</i> keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They say to their mothers, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach <i class="calibre6">is</i> great like the sea: who can heal thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>All that pass by clap <i class="calibre6">their</i> hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, <i class="calibre6">saying, Is</i> this the city that <i class="calibre6">men</i> call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed <i class="calibre6">her</i> up: certainly this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>The LORD hath done <i class="calibre6">that</i> which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused <i class="calibre6">thine</i> enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, <i class="calibre6">and</i> children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain <i class="calibre6">them</i> in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not pitied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD'S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.</p></div></body></html>
