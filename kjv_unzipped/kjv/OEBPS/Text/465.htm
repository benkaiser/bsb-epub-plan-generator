  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job's Former Blessings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Oh that I were as <i class="calibre6">in</i> months past, as <i class="calibre6">in</i> the days <i class="calibre6">when</i> God preserved me;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>When his candle shined upon my head, <i class="calibre6">and when</i> by his light I walked <i class="calibre6">through</i> darkness;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon my tabernacle;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the Almighty <i class="calibre6">was</i> yet with me, <i class="calibre6">when</i> my children <i class="calibre6">were</i> about me;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>When I went out to the gate through the city, <i class="calibre6">when</i> I prepared my seat in the street!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, <i class="calibre6">and</i> stood up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The princes refrained talking, and laid <i class="calibre6">their</i> hand on their mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>When the ear heard <i class="calibre6">me</i>, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw <i class="calibre6">me</i>, it gave witness to me:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and <i class="calibre6">him that had</i> none to help him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment <i class="calibre6">was</i> as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I was eyes to the blind, and feet <i class="calibre6">was</i> I to the lame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>I <i class="calibre6">was</i> a father to the poor: and the cause <i class="calibre6">which</i> I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply <i class="calibre6">my</i> days as the sand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>My root <i class="calibre6">was</i> spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>My glory <i class="calibre6">was</i> fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Unto me <i class="calibre6">men</i> gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide <i class="calibre6">as</i> for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span><i class="calibre6">If</i> I laughed on them, they believed <i class="calibre6">it</i> not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one <i class="calibre6">that</i> comforteth the mourners.</p></div></body></html>
