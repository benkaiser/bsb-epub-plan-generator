  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Greeting to Timothy<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Timothy 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> our hope;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Unto Timothy, <i class="calibre6">my</i> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="hdg">Warning against False Teaching</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <i class="calibre6">so do</i>. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> a good conscience, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> faith unfeigned: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But we know that the law <i class="calibre6">is</i> good, if a man use it lawfully; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Grace to Paul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <i class="calibre6">it</i> ignorantly in unbelief. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <i class="calibre6">be</i> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p></div></body></html>
