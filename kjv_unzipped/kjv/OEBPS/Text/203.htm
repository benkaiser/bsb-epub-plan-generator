<span class="reftext">2</span>And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was <i class="calibre6">thus</i>: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim <i class="calibre6">were</i> among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.</p></div></body></html>
