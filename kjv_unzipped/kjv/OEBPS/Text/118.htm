<span class="reftext">51</span>And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 
<span class="reftext">53</span>But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
