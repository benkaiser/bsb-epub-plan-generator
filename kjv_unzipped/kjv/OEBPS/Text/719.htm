<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong <i class="calibre6">hand</i>, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward <i class="calibre6">is</i> with him, and his work before him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry <i class="calibre6">them</i> in his bosom, <i class="calibre6">and</i> shall gently lead those that are with young.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>All nations before him <i class="calibre6">are</i> as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>He that <i class="calibre6">is</i> so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree <i class="calibre6">that</i> will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall not be moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these <i class="calibre6">things</i>, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that <i class="calibre6">he is</i> strong in power; not one faileth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no searching of his understanding.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>He giveth power to the faint; and to <i class="calibre6">them that have</i> no might he increaseth strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew <i class="calibre6">their</i> strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; <i class="calibre6">and</i> they shall walk, and not faint.</p></div></body></html>
