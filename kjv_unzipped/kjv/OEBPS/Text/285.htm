  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Absalom Killed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And David numbered the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now <i class="calibre6">thou art</i> worth ten thousand of us: therefore now <i class="calibre6">it is</i> better that thou succour us out of the city. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, <i class="calibre6">Deal</i> gently for my sake with the young man, <i class="calibre6">even</i> with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand <i class="calibre6">men</i>. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i class="calibre6">was</i> under him went away. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And a certain man saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver, and a girdle. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver in mine hand, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none <i class="calibre6">touch</i> the young man Absalom. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against <i class="calibre6">me</i>. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he <i class="calibre6">was</i> yet alive in the midst of the oak. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Mourns for Absalom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But howsoever, <i class="calibre6">said he</i>, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he <i class="calibre6">be</i> alone, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold <i class="calibre6">another</i> man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <i class="calibre6">is</i> a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And the king said, <i class="calibre6">Is</i> the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and <i class="calibre6">me</i> thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what <i class="calibre6">it was</i>. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the king said <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, Turn aside, <i class="calibre6">and</i> stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And the king said unto Cushi, <i class="calibre6">Is</i> the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do <i class="calibre6">thee</i> hurt, be as <i class="calibre6">that</i> young man <i class="calibre6">is</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p></div></body></html>
