  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Balaam's First Oracle</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on <i class="calibre6">every</i> altar a bullock and a ram. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon <i class="calibre6">every</i> altar a bullock and a ram. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, <i class="calibre6">whom</i> the LORD hath not defied?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth <i class="calibre6">part</i> of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed <i class="calibre6">them</i> altogether. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth?</p>
<p class="hdg">Balaam's Second Oracle</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on <i class="calibre6">every</i> altar. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet <i class="calibre6">the LORD</i> yonder. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>God <i class="calibre6">is</i> not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do <i class="calibre6">it</i>? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, I have received <i class="calibre6">commandment</i> to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God <i class="calibre6">is</i> with him, and the shout of a king <i class="calibre6">is</i> among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Surely <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no enchantment against Jacob, neither <i class="calibre6">is there</i> any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat <i class="calibre6">of</i> the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on <i class="calibre6">every</i> altar.</p></div></body></html>
