<span class="reftext">2</span>And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i class="calibre6">wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Conquers Jerusalem<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 5:6-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i class="calibre6">were</i>, the inhabitants of the land. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> the city of David. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Mightiest Warriors<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 23:8-39; 1 Chronicles 11:20-47)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>These also <i class="calibre6">are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i class="calibre6">by him</i> at one time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And after him <i class="calibre6">was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i class="calibre6">was one</i> of the three mighties. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they set themselves in the midst of <i class="calibre6">that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved <i class="calibre6">them</i> by a great deliverance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And David <i class="calibre6">was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison <i class="calibre6">was</i> then at Bethlehem. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> at the gate! 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i class="calibre6">was</i> by the gate, and took <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and brought <i class="calibre6">it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i class="calibre6">of</i> it, but poured it out to the LORD, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i class="calibre6">the jeopardy of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</p>

<span class="reftext">21</span>Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i class="calibre6">first</i> three.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i class="calibre6">great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand <i class="calibre6">was</i> a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>These <i class="calibre6">things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i class="calibre6">first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</p>
