<span class="reftext">2</span>When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh <i class="calibre6">like</i> the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and <i class="calibre6">when</i> the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight <i class="calibre6">be</i> deeper than the skin of his flesh, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>If the bright spot <i class="calibre6">be</i> white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight <i class="calibre6">be</i> not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up <i class="calibre6">him that hath</i> the plague seven days: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the plague in his sight be at a stay, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the plague <i class="calibre6">be</i> somewhat dark, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it <i class="calibre6">is but</i> a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And <i class="calibre6">if</i> the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a leprosy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the priest shall see <i class="calibre6">him</i>: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the rising <i class="calibre6">be</i> white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and <i class="calibre6">there be</i> quick raw flesh in the rising; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>It <i class="calibre6">is</i> an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of <i class="calibre6">him that hath</i> the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

<span class="reftext">14</span>But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: <i class="calibre6">for</i> the raw flesh <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a leprosy. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the priest shall see him: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce <i class="calibre6">him</i> clean <i class="calibre6">that hath</i> the plague: he <i class="calibre6">is</i> clean.</p>

<span class="reftext">23</span>But if the bright spot stay in his place, <i class="calibre6">and</i> spread not, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>

<span class="reftext">27</span>And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: <i class="calibre6">and</i> if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the plague of leprosy. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And if the bright spot stay in his place, <i class="calibre6">and</i> spread not in the skin, but it <i class="calibre6">be</i> somewhat dark; it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> an inflammation of the burning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

<span class="reftext">32</span>And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall <i class="calibre6">be</i> not in sight deeper than the skin; 
<span class="reftext">33</span>He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up <i class="calibre6">him that hath</i> the scall seven days more:

<span class="reftext">35</span>But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean.

<span class="reftext">39</span>Then the priest shall look: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">if</i> the bright spots in the skin of their flesh <i class="calibre6">be</i> darkish white; it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a freckled spot <i class="calibre6">that</i> groweth in the skin; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> clean.</p>

<span class="reftext">44</span>He is a leprous man, he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague <i class="calibre6">is</i> in his head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>And the leper in whom the plague <i class="calibre6">is</i>, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
