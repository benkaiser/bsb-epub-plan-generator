<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> your plowmen and your vinedressers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: <i class="calibre6">men</i> shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For your shame <i class="calibre6">ye shall have</i> double; and <i class="calibre6">for</i> confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the seed <i class="calibre6">which</i> the LORD hath blessed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh <i class="calibre6">himself</i> with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth <i class="calibre6">herself</i> with her jewels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</p></div></body></html>
