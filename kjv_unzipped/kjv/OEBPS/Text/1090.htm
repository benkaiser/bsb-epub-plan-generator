  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Revelation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) 
<span class="reftext">4</span>How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <i class="calibre6">now</i> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <i class="calibre6">to be</i>, or <i class="calibre6">that</i> he heareth of me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Thorn and God's Grace</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p class="hdg">Concern for the Corinthian Church</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <i class="calibre6">it be</i> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>I desired Titus, and with <i class="calibre6">him</i> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <i class="calibre6">walked we</i> not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <i class="calibre6">we do</i> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <i class="calibre6">there be</i> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
<span class="reftext">21</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</p></div></body></html>
