<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <i class="calibre6">is</i> the accepted time; behold, now <i class="calibre6">is</i> the day of salvation.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But in all <i class="calibre6">things</i> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
<span class="reftext">8</span>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <i class="calibre6">yet</i> true; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>As unknown, and <i class="calibre6">yet</i> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i class="calibre6">yet</i> possessing all things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>O <i class="calibre6">ye</i> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <i class="calibre6">my</i> children,) be ye also enlarged.</p>

<span class="reftext">15</span>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <i class="calibre6">them</i>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <i class="calibre6">thing</i>; and I will receive you,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p></div></body></html>
