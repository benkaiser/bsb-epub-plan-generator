  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Longing for Her Beloved</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>O that thou <i class="calibre6">wert</i> as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! <i class="calibre6">when</i> I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I would lead thee, <i class="calibre6">and</i> bring thee into my mother's house, <i class="calibre6">who</i> would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>His left hand <i class="calibre6">should be</i> under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake <i class="calibre6">my</i> love, until he please.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Friends</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth <i class="calibre6">that</i> bare thee.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <i class="calibre6">is</i> strong as death; jealousy <i class="calibre6">is</i> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <i class="calibre6">are</i> coals of fire, <i class="calibre6">which hath</i> a most vehement flame.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Friends</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>If she <i class="calibre6">be</i> a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she <i class="calibre6">be</i> a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Bride</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand <i class="calibre6">pieces</i> of silver.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>My vineyard, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine, <i class="calibre6">is</i> before me: thou, O Solomon, <i class="calibre6">must have</i> a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Bride</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p></div></body></html>
