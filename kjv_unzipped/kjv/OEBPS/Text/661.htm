  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Futility of Pleasures</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>I said of laughter, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i class="calibre6">was</i> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all <i class="calibre6">kind of</i> fruits: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>I got <i class="calibre6">me</i> servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <i class="calibre6">as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all <i class="calibre6">was</i> vanity and vexation of spirit, and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no profit under the sun.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Wise and the Foolish</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <i class="calibre6">can</i> the man <i class="calibre6">do</i> that cometh after the king? <i class="calibre6">even</i> that which hath been already done. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>The wise man's eyes <i class="calibre6">are</i> in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise <i class="calibre6">man</i>? as the fool. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun <i class="calibre6">is</i> grievous unto me: for all <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Futility of Work</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise <i class="calibre6">man</i> or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> also vanity. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For there is a man whose labour <i class="calibre6">is</i> in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it <i class="calibre6">for</i> his portion. This also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity and a great evil. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For all his days <i class="calibre6">are</i> sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> nothing better for a man, <i class="calibre6">than</i> that he should eat and drink, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it <i class="calibre6">was</i> from the hand of God. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For who can eat, or who else can hasten <i class="calibre6">hereunto</i>, more than I? 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For <i class="calibre6">God</i> giveth to a man that <i class="calibre6">is</i> good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> good before God. This also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit.</p></div></body></html>
