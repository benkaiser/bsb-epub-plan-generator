And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But of the fruit of the tree which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when the woman saw that the tree <i class="calibre6">was</i> good for food, and that it <i class="calibre6">was</i> pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make <i class="calibre6">one</i> wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they <i class="calibre6">were</i> naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</p>
<p class="hdg">God Arraigns Adam and Eve</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I <i class="calibre6">was</i> naked; and I hid myself. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he said, Who told thee that thou <i class="calibre6">wast</i> naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest <i class="calibre6">to be</i> with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the LORD God said unto the woman, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> this <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Punishment of Mankind</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat <i class="calibre6">of</i> it all the days of thy life;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou <i class="calibre6">art</i>, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Expulsion from Paradise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p></div></body></html>
