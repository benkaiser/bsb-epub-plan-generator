  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Justice and Mercy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to <i class="calibre6">do</i> evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest <i class="calibre6">judgment</i>: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sabbath Laws<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 25:1-7; Deuteronomy 15:1-6)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But the seventh <i class="calibre6">year</i> thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with thy oliveyard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And in all <i class="calibre6">things</i> that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Three Yearly Feasts<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 23:1-3)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Angel to Lead<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 7:12-26)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name <i class="calibre6">is</i> in him. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.</p></div></body></html>
