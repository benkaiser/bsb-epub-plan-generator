<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The wicked in <i class="calibre6">his</i> pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, <i class="calibre6">whom</i> the LORD abhorreth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek <i class="calibre6">after God</i>: God <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in all his thoughts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>His ways are always grievous; thy judgments <i class="calibre6">are</i> far above out of his sight: <i class="calibre6">as for</i> all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for <i class="calibre6">I shall</i> never <i class="calibre6">be</i> in adversity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue <i class="calibre6">is</i> mischief and vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He croucheth, <i class="calibre6">and</i> humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou hast seen <i class="calibre6">it</i>; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite <i class="calibre6">it</i> with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil <i class="calibre6">man</i>: seek out his wickedness <i class="calibre6">till</i> thou find none.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p></div></body></html>
