<span class="reftext">2</span>It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Power of Faith<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 17:14-21; Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-42)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals Ten Lepers<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Kings 5:1-14)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And they lifted up <i class="calibre6">their</i> voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when he saw <i class="calibre6">them</i>, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And fell down on <i class="calibre6">his</i> face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where <i class="calibre6">are</i> the nine? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Coming of the Kingdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after <i class="calibre6">them</i>, nor follow <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one <i class="calibre6">part</i> under heaven, shineth unto the other <i class="calibre6">part</i> under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed <i class="calibre6">them</i> all. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Remember Lot's wife. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>I tell you, in that night there shall be two <i class="calibre6">men</i> in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Two <i class="calibre6">women</i> shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Two <i class="calibre6">men</i> shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body <i class="calibre6">is</i>, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</p></div></body></html>
