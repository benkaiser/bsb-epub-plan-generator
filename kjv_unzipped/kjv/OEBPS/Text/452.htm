  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job: Poor Comforters are You</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I have heard many such things: miserable comforters <i class="calibre6">are</i> ye all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I also could speak as ye <i class="calibre6">do</i>: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">But</i> I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage <i class="calibre6">your grief</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and <i class="calibre6">though</i> I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, <i class="calibre6">which</i> is a witness <i class="calibre6">against me</i>: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He teareth <i class="calibre6">me</i> in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken <i class="calibre6">me</i> by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids <i class="calibre6">is</i> the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Not for <i class="calibre6">any</i> injustice in mine hands: also my prayer <i class="calibre6">is</i> pure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Also now, behold, my witness <i class="calibre6">is</i> in heaven, and my record <i class="calibre6">is</i> on high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>My friends scorn me: <i class="calibre6">but</i> mine eye poureth out <i class="calibre6">tears</i> unto God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man <i class="calibre6">pleadeth</i> for his neighbour!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>When a few years are come, then I shall go the way <i class="calibre6">whence</i> I shall not return.</p></div></body></html>
