<span class="reftext">2</span>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead <i class="calibre6">men</i>. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Report of the Guards</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him <i class="calibre6">away</i> while we slept. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Great Commission<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 16:14-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto the end of the world. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
