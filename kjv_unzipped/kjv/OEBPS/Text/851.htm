  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Daniel Removed to Babylon<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 11:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <i class="calibre6">certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Children in whom <i class="calibre6">was</i> no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as <i class="calibre6">had</i> ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <i class="calibre6">the name</i> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</p>
<p class="hdg">Daniel's Faithfulness</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which <i class="calibre6">are</i> of your sort? then shall ye make <i class="calibre6">me</i> endanger my head to the king. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p class="hdg">Daniel's Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And in all matters of wisdom <i class="calibre6">and</i> understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i class="calibre6">and</i> astrologers that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in all his realm. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Daniel continued <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p></div></body></html>
