  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job: My Redeemer Lives</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And be it indeed <i class="calibre6">that</i> I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>If indeed ye will magnify <i class="calibre6">yourselves</i> against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown <i class="calibre6">from</i> my head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as <i class="calibre6">one of</i> his enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>I called my servant, and he gave <i class="calibre6">me</i> no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's <i class="calibre6">sake</i> of mine own body.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For I know <i class="calibre6">that</i> my redeemer liveth, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> he shall stand at the latter <i class="calibre6">day</i> upon the earth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And <i class="calibre6">though</i> after my skin <i class="calibre6">worms</i> destroy this <i class="calibre6">body</i>, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; <i class="calibre6">though</i> my reins be consumed within me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath <i class="calibre6">bringeth</i> the punishments of the sword, that ye may know <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a judgment.</p></div></body></html>
