<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Let the redeemed of the LORD say <i class="calibre6">so</i>, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Oh that <i class="calibre6">men</i> would praise the LORD <i class="calibre6">for</i> his goodness, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, <i class="calibre6">being</i> bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none to help.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Oh that <i class="calibre6">men</i> would praise the LORD <i class="calibre6">for</i> his goodness, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered <i class="calibre6">them</i> from their destructions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Oh that <i class="calibre6">men</i> would praise the LORD <i class="calibre6">for</i> his goodness, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Oh that <i class="calibre6">men</i> would praise the LORD <i class="calibre6">for</i> his goodness, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, <i class="calibre6">where there is</i> no way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh <i class="calibre6">him</i> families like a flock.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>The righteous shall see <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Whoso <i class="calibre6">is</i> wise, and will observe these <i class="calibre6">things</i>, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
