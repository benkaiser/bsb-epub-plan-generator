  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job Responds: He Longs for God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Even to day <i class="calibre6">is</i> my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Oh that I knew where I might find him! <i class="calibre6">that</i> I might come <i class="calibre6">even</i> to his seat!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I would order <i class="calibre6">my</i> cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>I would know the words <i class="calibre6">which</i> he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Will he plead against me with <i class="calibre6">his</i> great power? No; but he would put <i class="calibre6">strength</i> in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Behold, I go forward, but he <i class="calibre6">is</i> not <i class="calibre6">there</i>; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold <i class="calibre6">him</i>: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see <i class="calibre6">him</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But he knoweth the way that I take: <i class="calibre6">when</i> he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary <i class="calibre6">food</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But he <i class="calibre6">is</i> in one <i class="calibre6">mind</i>, and who can turn him? and <i class="calibre6">what</i> his soul desireth, even <i class="calibre6">that</i> he doeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For he performeth <i class="calibre6">the thing that is</i> appointed for me: and many such <i class="calibre6">things are</i> with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Because I was not cut off before the darkness, <i class="calibre6">neither</i> hath he covered the darkness from my face.</p></div></body></html>
