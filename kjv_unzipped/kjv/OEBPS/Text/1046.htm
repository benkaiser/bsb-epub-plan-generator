  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul at Malta</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i class="calibre6">them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when the barbarians saw the <i class="calibre6">venomous</i> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i class="calibre6">us</i> with such things as were necessary.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Arrives at Rome</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i class="calibre6">there</i> three days. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Preaches at Rome</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i class="calibre6">and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i class="calibre6">me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when the Jews spake against <i class="calibre6">it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i class="calibre6">you</i>, and to speak with <i class="calibre6">you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i class="calibre6">his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i class="calibre6">out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i class="calibre6">their</i> eyes, and hear with <i class="calibre6">their</i> ears, and understand with <i class="calibre6">their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> they will hear it. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p></div></body></html>
