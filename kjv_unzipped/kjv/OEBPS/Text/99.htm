<span class="reftext">2</span>And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer <i class="calibre6">them</i> before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, <i class="calibre6">both</i> of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And they brought <i class="calibre6">that</i> which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Moses said, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Sin Offering<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 6:24-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> for himself. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Burnt Offering<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 6:8-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt <i class="calibre6">them</i> upon the altar. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt <i class="calibre6">them</i> upon the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Offerings for the People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He slew also the bullock and the ram <i class="calibre6">for</i> a sacrifice of peace offerings, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth <i class="calibre6">the inwards</i>, and the kidneys, and the caul <i class="calibre6">above</i> the liver: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved <i class="calibre6">for</i> a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moses and Aaron Bless the People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <i class="calibre6">which</i> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p></div></body></html>
