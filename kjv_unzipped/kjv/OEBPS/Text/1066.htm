  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Servants of Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Do Not Be Proud</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i class="calibre6">to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i class="calibre6">of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For who maketh thee to differ <i class="calibre6">from another</i>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <i class="calibre6">it</i>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <i class="calibre6">it</i>?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>We <i class="calibre6">are</i> fools for Christ's sake, but ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> wise in Christ; we <i class="calibre6">are</i> weak, but ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> strong; ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> honourable, but we <i class="calibre6">are</i> despised. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <i class="calibre6">and are</i> the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Warns his Spiritual Children</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <i class="calibre6">you</i>. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i class="calibre6">have ye</i> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the kingdom of God <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in word, but in power. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the spirit of meekness?</p></div></body></html>
