<span class="reftext">2</span>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The aged women likewise, that <i class="calibre6">they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 
<span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

<span class="reftext">12</span>Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p></div></body></html>
