  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Cast Your Cares on the Lord<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 17:15-29)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, <i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! <i class="calibre6">for then</i> would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Lo, <i class="calibre6">then</i> would I wander far off, <i class="calibre6">and</i> remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I would hasten my escape from the windy storm <i class="calibre6">and</i> tempest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Destroy, O Lord, <i class="calibre6">and</i> divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Wickedness <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For <i class="calibre6">it was</i> not an enemy <i class="calibre6">that</i> reproached me; then I could have borne <i class="calibre6">it</i>: neither <i class="calibre6">was it</i> he that hated me <i class="calibre6">that</i> did magnify <i class="calibre6">himself</i> against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But <i class="calibre6">it was</i> thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>We took sweet counsel together, <i class="calibre6">and</i> walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Let death seize upon them, <i class="calibre6">and</i> let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness <i class="calibre6">is</i> in their dwellings, <i class="calibre6">and</i> among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle <i class="calibre6">that was</i> against me: for there were many with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span><i class="calibre6">The words</i> of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war <i class="calibre6">was</i> in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet <i class="calibre6">were</i> they drawn swords.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p></div></body></html>
