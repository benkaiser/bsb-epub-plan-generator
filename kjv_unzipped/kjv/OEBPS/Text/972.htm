<span class="reftext">2</span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Crowd Chooses Barabbas<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 27:15-23; Luke 23:13-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now at <i class="calibre6">that</i> feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And there was <i class="calibre6">one</i> named Barabbas, <i class="calibre6">which lay</i> bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire <i class="calibre6">him to do</i> as he had ever done unto them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 27:24-26)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And <i class="calibre6">so</i> Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged <i class="calibre6">him</i>, to be crucified.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Soldiers Mock Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 50:4-11; Matthew 27:27-31; Luke 22:63-65; John 19:1-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his <i class="calibre6">head</i>, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing <i class="calibre6">their</i> knees worshipped him. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Crucifixion<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 69:1-36; Matthew 27:32-44; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:16-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received <i class="calibre6">it</i> not. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest <i class="calibre6">it</i> in three days, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Death of Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 22:1-31; Matthew 27:45-56; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:28-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And some of them that stood by, when they heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put <i class="calibre6">it</i> on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
<span class="reftext">41</span>(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>

<span class="reftext">43</span>Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counseller, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And when he knew <i class="calibre6">it</i> of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>And Mary Magdalene and Mary <i class="calibre6">the mother</i> of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p></div></body></html>
