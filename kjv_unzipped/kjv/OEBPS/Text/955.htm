<span class="reftext">2</span>Ye know that after two days is <i class="calibre6">the feast of</i> the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill <i class="calibre6">him</i>. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But they said, Not on the feast <i class="calibre6">day</i>, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Anointed at Bethany<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat <i class="calibre6">at meat</i>. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But when his disciples saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose <i class="calibre6">is</i> this waste? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>When Jesus understood <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did <i class="calibre6">it</i> for my burial. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, <i class="calibre6">there</i> shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="hdg">Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Zechariah 11:10-17; Matthew 27:3-10; Mark 14:10-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And said <i class="calibre6">unto them</i>, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Last Supper<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 41:1-13; Mark 14:12-21; Luke 22:7-13; John 13:18-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the <i class="calibre6">feast of</i> unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he answered and said, He that dippeth <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord's Supper Instituted<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:14-23; 1 Corinthians 11:17-34)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and brake <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-38; John 13:36-38)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all <i class="calibre6">men</i> shall be offended because of thee, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> will I never be offended. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Prays at Gethsemane<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou <i class="calibre6">wilt</i>. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
<span class="reftext">41</span>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed <i class="calibre6">is</i> willing, but the flesh <i class="calibre6">is</i> weak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take <i class="calibre6">your</i> rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus' Betrayal and Arrest<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:43-52; Luke 22:47-53; John 18:1-14)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">51</span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. 
<span class="reftext">53</span>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? 
<span class="reftext">54</span>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">55</span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. 
<span class="reftext">56</span>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Before the Sanhedrin<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 53:1-8; Mark 14:53-65; John 18:19-24; 1 Peter 2:21-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">57</span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led <i class="calibre6">him</i> away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 
<span class="reftext">58</span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">59</span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 
<span class="reftext">60</span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, 
<span class="reftext">61</span>And said, This <i class="calibre6">fellow</i> said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 
<span class="reftext">62</span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what <i class="calibre6">is it which</i> these witness against thee? 
<span class="reftext">63</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. 
<span class="reftext">64</span>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">65</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 
<span class="reftext">66</span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">67</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote <i class="calibre6">him</i> with the palms of their hands, 
<span class="reftext">68</span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
<p class="hdg">Peter Denies Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:54-62; John 18:15-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">69</span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. 
<span class="reftext">70</span>But he denied before <i class="calibre6">them</i> all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
<span class="reftext">71</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another <i class="calibre6">maid</i> saw him, and said unto them that were there, This <i class="calibre6">fellow</i> was also with Jesus of Nazareth. 
<span class="reftext">72</span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
<span class="reftext">73</span>And after a while came unto <i class="calibre6">him</i> they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art <i class="calibre6">one</i> of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 
<span class="reftext">74</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 
<span class="reftext">75</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p></div></body></html>
