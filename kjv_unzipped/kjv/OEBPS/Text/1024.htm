<span class="reftext">2</span>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples <i class="calibre6">unto them</i>, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid <i class="calibre6">their</i> hands on them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>
<p class="hdg">Stephen Arrested</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called <i class="calibre6">the synagogue</i> of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and <i class="calibre6">against</i> God. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and caught him, and brought <i class="calibre6">him</i> to the council, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p></div></body></html>
