<span class="reftext">2</span>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Who will render to every man according to his deeds: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>(For not the hearers of the law <i class="calibre6">are</i> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;) 
<span class="reftext">16</span>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Jews and the Law</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And knowest <i class="calibre6">his</i> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <i class="calibre6">is that</i> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <i class="calibre6">is that</i> of the heart, in the spirit, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not in the letter; whose praise <i class="calibre6">is</i> not of men, but of God.</p></div></body></html>
