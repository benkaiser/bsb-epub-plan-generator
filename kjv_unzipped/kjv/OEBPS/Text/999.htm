<span class="reftext">2</span>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: <i class="calibre6">but</i> thou hast kept the good wine until now. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Cleanses the Temple<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 21:12-17; Mark 11:15-19; Luke 19:45-48)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But he spake of the temple of his body. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast <i class="calibre6">day</i>, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p></div></body></html>
