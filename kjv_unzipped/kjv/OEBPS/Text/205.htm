  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Tabernacle at Shiloh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Remainder Divided</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long <i class="calibre6">are</i> ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Give out from among you three men for <i class="calibre6">each</i> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come <i class="calibre6">again</i> to me. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Ye shall therefore describe the land <i class="calibre6">into</i> seven parts, and bring <i class="calibre6">the description</i> hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came <i class="calibre6">again</i> to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions.</p>
<p class="hdg">Benjamin's Territory</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that <i class="calibre6">lieth</i> on the south side of the nether Bethhoron. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the border was drawn <i class="calibre6">thence</i>, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that <i class="calibre6">lieth</i> before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this <i class="calibre6">was</i> the west quarter. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the south quarter <i class="calibre6">was</i> from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the border came down to the end of the mountain that <i class="calibre6">lieth</i> before the valley of the son of Hinnom, <i class="calibre6">and</i> which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this <i class="calibre6">was</i> the south coast. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This <i class="calibre6">was</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz, 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Jerusalem, Gibeath, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.</p></div></body></html>
