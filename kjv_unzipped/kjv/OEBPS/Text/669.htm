  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Wisdom and Folly</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: <i class="calibre6">so doth</i> a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom <i class="calibre6">and</i> honour. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>A wise man's heart <i class="calibre6">is</i> at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and he saith to every one <i class="calibre6">that</i> he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a fool. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>There is an evil <i class="calibre6">which</i> I have seen under the sun, as an error <i class="calibre6">which</i> proceedeth from the ruler: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; <i class="calibre6">and</i> he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom <i class="calibre6">is</i> profitable to direct. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The words of a wise man's mouth <i class="calibre6">are</i> gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The beginning of the words of his mouth <i class="calibre6">is</i> foolishness: and the end of his talk <i class="calibre6">is</i> mischievous madness. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <i class="calibre6">is</i> a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou, O land, when thy king <i class="calibre6">is</i> the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! 
<span class="reftext">18</span>By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all <i class="calibre6">things</i>. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p></div></body></html>
