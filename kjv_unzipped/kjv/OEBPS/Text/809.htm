<span class="reftext">2</span>Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now <i class="calibre6">is</i> the end <i class="calibre6">come</i> upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble <i class="calibre6">is</i> near, and not the sounding again of the mountains. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations <i class="calibre6">that</i> are in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD that smiteth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them <i class="calibre6">shall remain</i>, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <i class="calibre6">shall there be</i> wailing for them. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon all the multitude thereof. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision <i class="calibre6">is</i> touching the whole multitude thereof, <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Desolation of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon all the multitude thereof. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the field shall die with the sword; and he that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak <i class="calibre6">as</i> water. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>They shall also gird <i class="calibre6">themselves</i> with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations <i class="calibre6">and</i> of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret <i class="calibre6">place</i>: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and <i class="calibre6">there shall be</i> none. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
