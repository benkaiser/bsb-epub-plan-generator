  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">True Fasts and Sabbaths</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Wherefore have we fasted, <i class="calibre6">say they</i>, and thou seest not? <i class="calibre6">wherefore</i> have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as <i class="calibre6">ye do this</i> day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? <i class="calibre6">is it</i> to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes <i class="calibre6">under him</i>? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Is it</i> not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I <i class="calibre6">am</i>. If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And <i class="calibre6">if</i> thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness <i class="calibre6">be</i> as the noonday:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And <i class="calibre6">they that shall be</i> of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <i class="calibre6">from</i> doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <i class="calibre6">thine own</i> words:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
