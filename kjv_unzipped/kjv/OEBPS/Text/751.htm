<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate <i class="calibre6">woman</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch <i class="calibre6">their</i> tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the city to be visited; she <i class="calibre6">is</i> wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually <i class="calibre6">is</i> grief and wounds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel's Rebellion and God's Wrath<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Jeremiah 25:15-33; Jonah 1:4-10; Acts 27:13-26; Romans 1:18-32)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear <i class="calibre6">is</i> uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> full of days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And their houses shall be turned unto others, <i class="calibre6">with their</i> fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one <i class="calibre6">is</i> given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>They have healed also the hurt <i class="calibre6">of the daughter</i> of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time <i class="calibre6">that</i> I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk <i class="calibre6">therein</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Also I set watchmen over you, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what <i class="calibre6">is</i> among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings <i class="calibre6">are</i> not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</p>
<p class="hdg">An Invasion from the North</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they <i class="calibre6">are</i> cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, <i class="calibre6">and</i> pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy <i class="calibre6">and</i> fear <i class="calibre6">is</i> on every side.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>O daughter of my people, gird <i class="calibre6">thee</i> with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, <i class="calibre6">as for</i> an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>I have set thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> a tower <i class="calibre6">and</i> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: <i class="calibre6">they are</i> brass and iron; they <i class="calibre6">are</i> all corrupters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Reprobate silver shall <i class="calibre6">men</i> call them, because the LORD hath rejected them.</p></div></body></html>
