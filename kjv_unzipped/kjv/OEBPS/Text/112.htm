<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name <i class="calibre6">in those things</i> which they hallow unto me: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Say unto them, Whosoever <i class="calibre6">he be</i> of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>What man soever of the seed of Aaron <i class="calibre6">is</i> a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing <i class="calibre6">that is</i> unclean <i class="calibre6">by</i> the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;</p>
<p class="hdg">Instructions for Cleansing</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it <i class="calibre6">is</i> his food. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>That which dieth of itself, or is torn <i class="calibre6">with beasts</i>, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>There shall no stranger eat <i class="calibre6">of</i> the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat <i class="calibre6">of</i> the holy thing. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But if the priest buy <i class="calibre6">any</i> soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>If the priest's daughter also be <i class="calibre6">married</i> unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if a man eat <i class="calibre6">of</i> the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth <i class="calibre6">part</i> thereof unto it, and shall give <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto the priest with the holy thing. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

<span class="reftext">22</span>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer <i class="calibre6">for</i> a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

<span class="reftext">30</span>On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.
