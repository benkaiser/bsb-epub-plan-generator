  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Do Not Judge Your Brother<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 7:1-6; Luke 6:37-42)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <i class="calibre6">but</i> not to doubtful disputations. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <i class="calibre6">alike</i>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <i class="calibre6">it</i>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For it is written, <i class="calibre6">As</i> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Do Not Cause Your Brother to Stumble<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Ezekiel 14:1-11; 1 Corinthians 8:1-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <i class="calibre6">his</i> brother's way. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <i class="calibre6">there is</i> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him <i class="calibre6">it is</i> unclean. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if thy brother be grieved with <i class="calibre6">thy</i> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For he that in these things serveth Christ <i class="calibre6">is</i> acceptable to God, and approved of men. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed <i class="calibre6">are</i> pure; but <i class="calibre6">it is</i> evil for that man who eateth with offence. 
<span class="reftext">21</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <i class="calibre6">any thing</i> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Hast thou faith? have <i class="calibre6">it</i> to thyself before God. Happy <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because <i class="calibre6">he eateth</i> not of faith: for whatsoever <i class="calibre6">is</i> not of faith is sin.</p></div></body></html>
