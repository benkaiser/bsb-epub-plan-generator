  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Prophecy of Moab's Devastation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i>, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, <i class="calibre6">so</i> the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>We have heard of the pride of Moab; <i class="calibre6">he is</i> very proud: <i class="calibre6">even</i> of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: <i class="calibre6">but</i> his lies <i class="calibre6">shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> so.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely <i class="calibre6">they are</i> stricken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the fields of Heshbon languish, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto Jazer, they wandered <i class="calibre6">through</i> the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in <i class="calibre6">their</i> presses; I have made <i class="calibre6">their vintage</i> shouting to cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirharesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> very small <i class="calibre6">and</i> feeble.</p></div></body></html>
