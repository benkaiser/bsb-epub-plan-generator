<span class="reftext">2</span>If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind <i class="calibre6">herself</i> by a bond, <i class="calibre6">being</i> in her father's house in her youth; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And her husband heard <i class="calibre6">it,</i> and held his peace at her in the day that he heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And her husband heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and held his peace at her, <i class="calibre6">and</i> disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard <i class="calibre6">them; then</i> whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard <i class="calibre6">them</i>; then he shall bear her iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, <i class="calibre6">being yet</i> in her youth in her father's house.</p></div></body></html>
