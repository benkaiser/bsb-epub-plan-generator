  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Prophecy against Mount Seir</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed <i class="calibre6">the blood of</i> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time <i class="calibre6">that their</i> iniquity <i class="calibre6">had</i> an end: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore, <i class="calibre6">as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I will fill his mountains with his slain <i class="calibre6">men</i>: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore, <i class="calibre6">as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And thou shalt know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, <i class="calibre6">and that</i> I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all of it: and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
