<span class="reftext">2</span>Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries. 
<span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">Those that be</i> near, and <i class="calibre6">those that be</i> far from thee, shall mock thee, <i class="calibre6">which art</i> infamous <i class="calibre6">and</i> much vexed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and will do <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Refining Furnace</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they <i class="calibre6">are</i> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are <i class="calibre6">even</i> the dross of silver. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">20</span><i class="calibre6">As</i> they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt <i class="calibre6">it</i>; so will I gather <i class="calibre6">you</i> in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave <i class="calibre6">you there</i>, and melt you. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Sins of Prophets, Priests, Princes</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Son of man, say unto her, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation. 
<span class="reftext">25</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed <i class="calibre6">difference</i> between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Her princes in the midst thereof <i class="calibre6">are</i> like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And her prophets have daubed them with untempered <i class="calibre6">morter</i>, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p></div></body></html>
