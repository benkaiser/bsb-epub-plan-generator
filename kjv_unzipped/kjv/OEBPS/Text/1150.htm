  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Warning against Pride</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>From whence <i class="calibre6">come</i> wars and fightings among you? <i class="calibre6">come they</i> not hence, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of your lusts that war in your members? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon your lusts. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
<p class="hdg">Drawing Near to God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <i class="calibre6">your</i> hands, <i class="calibre6">ye</i> sinners; and purify <i class="calibre6">your</i> hearts, <i class="calibre6">ye</i> double minded. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and <i class="calibre6">your</i> joy to heaviness. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of <i class="calibre6">his</i> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</p>
<p class="hdg">Do Not Boast about Tomorrow</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Whereas ye know not what <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> on the morrow. For what <i class="calibre6">is</i> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For that ye <i class="calibre6">ought</i> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <i class="calibre6">it</i> not, to him it is sin.</p></div></body></html>
