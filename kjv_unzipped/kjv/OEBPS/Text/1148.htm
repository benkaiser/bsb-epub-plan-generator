<span class="reftext">2</span>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i class="calibre6">point</i>, he is guilty of all. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="hdg">Faith and Works<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 15:1-7; Romans 4:1-12; Galatians 3:1-9; Hebrews 11:8-19)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>What <i class="calibre6">doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <i class="calibre6">ye</i> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <i class="calibre6">doth it</i> profit? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <i class="calibre6">them</i> out another way? 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p></div></body></html>
