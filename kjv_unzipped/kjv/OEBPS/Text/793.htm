<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">There shall be</i> no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from <i class="calibre6">being</i> a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>A voice of crying <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity <i class="calibre6">with</i> his priests and his princes together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Cursed <i class="calibre6">be</i> he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed <i class="calibre6">be</i> he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>How say ye, We <i class="calibre6">are</i> mighty and strong men for the war?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Moab is spoiled, and gone up <i class="calibre6">out of</i> her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The calamity of Moab <i class="calibre6">is</i> near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the beautiful rod!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from <i class="calibre6">thy</i> glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he shall destroy thy strong holds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, <i class="calibre6">and</i> say, What is done?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Make ye him drunken: for he magnified <i class="calibre6">himself</i> against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove <i class="calibre6">that</i> maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but <i class="calibre6">it shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> so; his lies shall not so effect <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; <i class="calibre6">mine heart</i> shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; <i class="calibre6">their</i> shouting <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> no shouting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>From the cry of Heshbon <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto Elealeh, <i class="calibre6">and even</i> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto Horonaim, <i class="calibre6">as</i> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches <i class="calibre6">that</i> he hath gotten are perished. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>For every head <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
<span class="reftext">38</span><i class="calibre6">There shall be</i> lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein <i class="calibre6">is</i> no pleasure, saith the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>They shall howl, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>And Moab shall be destroyed from <i class="calibre6">being</i> a people, because he hath magnified <i class="calibre6">himself</i> against the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, <i class="calibre6">even</i> upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far <i class="calibre6">is</i> the judgment of Moab.</p></div></body></html>
