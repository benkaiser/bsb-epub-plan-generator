  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Peter and John Before the Council</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they laid hands on them, and put <i class="calibre6">them</i> in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, <i class="calibre6">even</i> by him doth this man stand here before you whole. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
<p class="hdg">Peter and John Threatened, Released</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them <i class="calibre6">is</i> manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all <i class="calibre6">men</i> glorified God for that which was done. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Believers' Prayer for Boldness<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 2:1-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together, 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sharing among Believers<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Acts 2:42-47)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <i class="calibre6">of them</i> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And laid <i class="calibre6">them</i> down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <i class="calibre6">and</i> of the country of Cyprus, 
<span class="reftext">37</span>Having land, sold <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and brought the money, and laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> at the apostles' feet.</p></div></body></html>
