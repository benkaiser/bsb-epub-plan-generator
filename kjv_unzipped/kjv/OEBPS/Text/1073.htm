  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Roles in Worship</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i class="calibre6">am</i> of Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <i class="calibre6">them</i> to you. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <i class="calibre6">is</i> the man; and the head of Christ <i class="calibre6">is</i> God. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having <i class="calibre6">his</i> head covered, dishonoureth his head. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <i class="calibre6">her</i> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For a man indeed ought not to cover <i class="calibre6">his</i> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For this cause ought the woman to have power on <i class="calibre6">her</i> head because of the angels. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For as the woman <i class="calibre6">is</i> of the man, even so <i class="calibre6">is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <i class="calibre6">her</i> hair is given her for a covering. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Observing the Lord's Supper<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 26:26-30; Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:14-23)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now in this that I declare <i class="calibre6">unto you</i> I praise <i class="calibre6">you</i> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>When ye come together therefore into one place, <i class="calibre6">this</i> is not to eat the Lord's supper. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For in eating every one taketh before <i class="calibre6">other</i> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <i class="calibre6">you</i> not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <i class="calibre6">same</i> night in which he was betrayed took bread: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And when he had given thanks, he brake <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>After the same manner also <i class="calibre6">he took</i> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i class="calibre6">it</i>, in remembrance of me. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <i class="calibre6">this</i> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <i class="calibre6">that</i> bread, and drink of <i class="calibre6">that</i> cup. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>For this cause many <i class="calibre6">are</i> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p></div></body></html>
