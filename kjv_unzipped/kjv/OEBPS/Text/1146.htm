  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Love for Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Let brotherly love continue. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; <i class="calibre6">and</i> them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Marriage <i class="calibre6">is</i> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Christ is the Same</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">Let your</i> conversation <i class="calibre6">be</i> without covetousness; <i class="calibre6">and be</i> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>So that we may boldly say, The Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of <i class="calibre6">their</i> conversation. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For <i class="calibre6">it is</i> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sacrifices and Prayer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <i class="calibre6">our</i> lips giving thanks to his name. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <i class="calibre6">is</i> unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But I beseech <i class="calibre6">you</i> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
<p class="hdg">Benediction and Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Know ye that <i class="calibre6">our</i> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you all. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
