  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Live to Please God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <i class="calibre6">you</i> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <i class="calibre6">so</i> ye would abound more and more. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For this is the will of God, <i class="calibre6">even</i> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>That no <i class="calibre6">man</i> go beyond and defraud his brother in <i class="calibre6">any</i> matter: because that the Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Return of the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <i class="calibre6">and</i> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then we which are alive <i class="calibre6">and</i> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p></div></body></html>
