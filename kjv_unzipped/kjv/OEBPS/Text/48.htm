  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And it came to pass after these things, that <i class="calibre6">one</i> told Joseph, Behold, thy father <i class="calibre6">is</i> sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And <i class="calibre6">one</i> told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee <i class="calibre6">for</i> an everlasting possession. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, <i class="calibre6">are</i> mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, <i class="calibre6">and</i> shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet <i class="calibre6">there was</i> but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who <i class="calibre6">are</i> these? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Joseph said unto his father, They <i class="calibre6">are</i> my sons, whom God hath given me in this <i class="calibre6">place</i>. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, <i class="calibre6">so that</i> he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought <i class="calibre6">them</i> near unto him. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon Ephraim's head, who <i class="calibre6">was</i> the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh <i class="calibre6">was</i> the firstborn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And his father refused, and said, I know <i class="calibre6">it</i>, my son, I know <i class="calibre6">it</i>: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p></div></body></html>
