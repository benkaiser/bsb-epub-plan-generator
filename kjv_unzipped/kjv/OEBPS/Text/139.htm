  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Balak Summons Balaam</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan <i class="calibre6">by</i> Jericho.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they <i class="calibre6">were</i> many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all <i class="calibre6">that are</i> round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor <i class="calibre6">was</i> king of the Moabites at that time. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, <i class="calibre6">that</i> we may smite them, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest <i class="calibre6">is</i> blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men <i class="calibre6">are</i> these with thee? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> blessed. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <i class="calibre6">and</i> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Angel and Balaam's Donkey</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <i class="calibre6">being</i> on this side, and a wall on that side. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <i class="calibre6">was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the ass said unto Balaam, <i class="calibre6">Am</i> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <i class="calibre6">I was</i> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <i class="calibre6">thy</i> way is perverse before me: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the border of Arnon, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the utmost coast. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <i class="calibre6">part</i> of the people.</p></div></body></html>
