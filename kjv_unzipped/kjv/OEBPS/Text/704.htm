<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For thou hast made of a city an heap; <i class="calibre6">of</i> a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones <i class="calibre6">is</i> as a storm <i class="calibre6">against</i> the wall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; <i class="calibre6">even</i> the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <i class="calibre6">his hands</i> to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, <i class="calibre6">and</i> bring to the ground, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the dust.</p></div></body></html>
