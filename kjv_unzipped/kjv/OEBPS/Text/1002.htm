  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at the Pool of Bethesda</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep <i class="calibre6">market</i> a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time <i class="calibre6">in that case</i>, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry <i class="calibre6">thy</i> bed. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in <i class="calibre6">that</i> place. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Father and the Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth <i class="calibre6">them</i>; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>That all <i class="calibre6">men</i> should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Testimonies about Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>But I have greater witness than <i class="calibre6">that</i> of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
<p class="hdg">Witness of the Scripture<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 16:19-31)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>I receive not honour from men. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that <i class="calibre6">cometh</i> from God only? 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is <i class="calibre6">one</i> that accuseth you, <i class="calibre6">even</i> Moses, in whom ye trust. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p></div></body></html>
