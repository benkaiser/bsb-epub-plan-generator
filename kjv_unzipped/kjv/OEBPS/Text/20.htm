  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Abraham, Sarah and Abimelech</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She <i class="calibre6">is</i> my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou <i class="calibre6">art but</i> a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she <i class="calibre6">is</i> a man's wife. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Said he not unto me, She <i class="calibre6">is</i> my sister? and she, even she herself said, He <i class="calibre6">is</i> my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Now therefore restore the man <i class="calibre6">his</i> wife; for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore <i class="calibre6">her</i> not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that <i class="calibre6">are</i> thine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And yet indeed <i class="calibre6">she is</i> my sister; she <i class="calibre6">is</i> the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He <i class="calibre6">is</i> my brother. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land <i class="calibre6">is</i> before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand <i class="calibre6">pieces</i> of silver: behold, he <i class="calibre6">is</i> to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that <i class="calibre6">are</i> with thee, and with all <i class="calibre6">other</i>: thus she was reproved. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare <i class="calibre6">children</i>. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p></div></body></html>
