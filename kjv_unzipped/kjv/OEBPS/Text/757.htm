<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Answer to Jeremiah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and <i class="calibre6">if</i> in the land of peace, <i class="calibre6">wherein</i> thou trustedst, <i class="calibre6">they wearied thee</i>, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Mine heritage <i class="calibre6">is</i> unto me <i class="calibre6">as</i> a speckled bird, the birds round about <i class="calibre6">are</i> against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>They have made it desolate, <i class="calibre6">and being</i> desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth <i class="calibre6">it</i> to heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the <i class="calibre6">one</i> end of the land even to the <i class="calibre6">other</i> end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, <i class="calibre6">but</i> shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Message for Israel's Neighbors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
