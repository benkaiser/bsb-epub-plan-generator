<span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <i class="calibre6">was</i> at Shushan <i class="calibre6">in</i> the palace, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had <i class="calibre6">two</i> horns: and the <i class="calibre6">two</i> horns <i class="calibre6">were</i> high; but one <i class="calibre6">was</i> higher than the other, and the higher came up last. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither <i class="calibre6">was there any</i> that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat <i class="calibre6">had</i> a notable horn between his eyes. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he came to the ram that had <i class="calibre6">two</i> horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i class="calibre6">land</i>. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And it waxed great, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Yea, he magnified <i class="calibre6">himself</i> even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily <i class="calibre6">sacrifice</i> was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And an host was given <i class="calibre6">him</i> against the daily <i class="calibre6">sacrifice</i> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that certain <i class="calibre6">saint</i> which spake, How long <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the vision <i class="calibre6">concerning</i> the daily <i class="calibre6">sacrifice</i>, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p class="hdg">Gabriel Interprets Daniel's Vision</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And it came to pass, when I, <i class="calibre6">even</i> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I heard a man's voice between <i class="calibre6">the banks of</i> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <i class="calibre6">man</i> to understand the vision. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the vision.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end <i class="calibre6">shall be</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The ram which thou sawest having <i class="calibre6">two</i> horns <i class="calibre6">are</i> the kings of Media and Persia.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the rough goat <i class="calibre6">is</i> the king of Grecia: and the great horn that <i class="calibre6">is</i> between his eyes <i class="calibre6">is</i> the first king. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <i class="calibre6">himself</i> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <i class="calibre6">is</i> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> for many days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <i class="calibre6">certain</i> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
