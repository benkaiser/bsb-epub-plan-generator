<span class="reftext">2</span>That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they <i class="calibre6">were</i> fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also <i class="calibre6">is</i> flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare <i class="calibre6">children</i> to them, the same <i class="calibre6">became</i> mighty men which <i class="calibre6">were</i> of old, men of renown.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And GOD saw that the wickedness of man <i class="calibre6">was</i> great in the earth, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> every imagination of the thoughts of his heart <i class="calibre6">was</i> only evil continually. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah's Favor with God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man <i class="calibre6">and</i> perfect in his generations, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Noah walked with God. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah Builds the Ark<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 9:1-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is the fashion</i> which thou shalt make it <i class="calibre6">of</i>: The length of the ark <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; <i class="calibre6">with</i> lower, second, and third <i class="calibre6">stories</i> shalt thou make it. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein <i class="calibre6">is</i> the breath of life, from under heaven; <i class="calibre6">and</i> every thing that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the earth shall die. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every <i class="calibre6">sort</i> shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep <i class="calibre6">them</i> alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every <i class="calibre6">sort</i> shall come unto thee, to keep <i class="calibre6">them</i> alive. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather <i class="calibre6">it</i> to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.</p></div></body></html>
