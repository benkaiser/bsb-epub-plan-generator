  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 6:12-15; 1 Chronicles 15:1-14; Colossians 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Thanksgiving and Prayer<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Corinthians 1:4-9; Colossians 1:3-14; 2 Thessalonians 1:3-4)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <i class="calibre6">it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <i class="calibre6">in</i> all judgment; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Trials Advance the Gospel<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(James 1:2-8)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <i class="calibre6">which happened</i> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <i class="calibre6">places</i>; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>According to my earnest expectation and <i class="calibre6">my</i> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <i class="calibre6">that</i> with all boldness, as always, <i class="calibre6">so</i> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <i class="calibre6">it be</i> by life, or by death.</p>
<p class="hdg">To Live is Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For to me to live <i class="calibre6">is</i> Christ, and to die <i class="calibre6">is</i> gain. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But if I live in the flesh, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <i class="calibre6">is</i> more needful for you. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</p>
<p class="hdg">Be Worthy of the Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake; 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <i class="calibre6">to be</i> in me.</p></div></body></html>
