  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Ministers of a New Covenant</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <i class="calibre6">others</i>, epistles of commendation to you, or <i class="calibre6">letters</i> of commendation from you? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 
<span class="reftext">3</span><i class="calibre6">Forasmuch as ye are</i> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <i class="calibre6">is</i> of God; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Glory of the New Covenant<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Exodus 34:29-35)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But if the ministration of death, written <i class="calibre6">and</i> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <i class="calibre6">glory</i> was to be done away: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For if the ministration of condemnation <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For if that which is done away <i class="calibre6">was</i> glorious, much more that which remaineth <i class="calibre6">is</i> glorious.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And not as Moses, <i class="calibre6">which</i> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <i class="calibre6">vail</i> is done away in Christ. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i>, there <i class="calibre6">is</i> liberty. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i class="calibre6">even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p></div></body></html>
