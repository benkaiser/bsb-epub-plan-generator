<span class="reftext">2</span>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing <i class="calibre6">their</i> nets. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they beckoned unto <i class="calibre6">their</i> partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>When Simon Peter saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And so <i class="calibre6">was</i> also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Leper's Prayer<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 14:1-32; Matthew 8:1-4; Mark 1:40-45)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on <i class="calibre6">his</i> face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he put forth <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals a Paralytic<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 9:1-8; Mark 2:1-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was <i class="calibre6">present</i> to heal them. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought <i class="calibre6">means</i> to bring him in, and to lay <i class="calibre6">him</i> before him. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And when they could not find by what <i class="calibre6">way</i> they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with <i class="calibre6">his</i> couch into the midst before Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Calls Levi<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 9:9-13; Mark 2:13-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Questioned about Fasting<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 9:14-15; Mark 2:18-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise <i class="calibre6">the disciples</i> of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>

<span class="reftext">37</span>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>No man also having drunk old <i class="calibre6">wine</i> straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.</p></div></body></html>
