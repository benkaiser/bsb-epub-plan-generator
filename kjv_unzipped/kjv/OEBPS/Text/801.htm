  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Distress of Zion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>How is the gold become dim! <i class="calibre6">how</i> is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people <i class="calibre6">is become</i> cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, <i class="calibre6">and</i> no man breaketh <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing <i class="calibre6">was</i> of sapphire:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">They that be</i> slain with the sword are better than <i class="calibre6">they that be</i> slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for <i class="calibre6">want of</i> the fruits of the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For the sins of her prophets, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>They have wandered <i class="calibre6">as</i> blind <i class="calibre6">men</i> in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>They cried unto them, Depart ye; <i class="calibre6">it is</i> unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn <i class="calibre6">there</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation <i class="calibre6">that</i> could not save <i class="calibre6">us</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</p></div></body></html>
