  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Lament for Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear ye this word which I take up against you, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none to raise her up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out <i class="calibre6">by</i> a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth <i class="calibre6">by</i> an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Call to Repentance<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Joel 1:13-20; Zephaniah 2:1-3; Luke 13:1-5)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and <i class="calibre6">there be</i> none to quench <i class="calibre6">it</i> in Bethel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span><i class="calibre6">Seek him</i> that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Forasmuch therefore as your treading <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate <i class="calibre6">from their right</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> an evil time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Coming Judgment</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And in all vineyards <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end <i class="calibre6">is</i> it for you? the day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> darkness, and not light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span><i class="calibre6">Shall</i> not the day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">be</i> darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept <i class="calibre6">them</i>: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name <i class="calibre6">is</i> The God of hosts.</p></div></body></html>
