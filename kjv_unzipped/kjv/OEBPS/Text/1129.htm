  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Preach the Word</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I charge <i class="calibre6">thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And they shall turn away <i class="calibre6">their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i class="calibre6">my</i> course, I have kept the faith: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="hdg">Personal Concerns</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i class="calibre6">with thee</i>, and the books, <i class="calibre6">but</i> especially the parchments. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord Remains Faithful</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i class="calibre6">men</i> forsook me: <i class="calibre6">I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i class="calibre6">me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with thy spirit. Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
