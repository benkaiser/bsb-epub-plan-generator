<span class="reftext">2</span>On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the tabernacle was reared up. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he set up the hanging <i class="calibre6">at</i> the door of the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he put the altar of burnt offering <i class="calibre6">by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash <i class="calibre6">withal</i>. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Glory of the Lord<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Numbers 9:15-23)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
<span class="reftext">37</span>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>For the cloud of the LORD <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p></div></body></html>
