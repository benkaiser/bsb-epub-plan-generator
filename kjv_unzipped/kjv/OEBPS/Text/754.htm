<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they <i class="calibre6">be</i> all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And they bend their tongues <i class="calibre6">like</i> their bow <i class="calibre6">for</i> lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, <i class="calibre6">and</i> weary themselves to commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thine habitation <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their tongue <i class="calibre6">is as</i> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: <i class="calibre6">one</i> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Shall I not visit them for these <i class="calibre6">things</i>? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through <i class="calibre6">them</i>; neither can <i class="calibre6">men</i> hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> the wise man, that may understand this? and <i class="calibre6">who is he</i> to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth <i class="calibre6">and</i> is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Weeping in Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning <i class="calibre6">women</i>, that they may come:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast <i class="calibre6">us</i> out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbour lamentation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For death is come up into our windows, <i class="calibre6">and</i> is entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the young men from the streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise <i class="calibre6">man</i> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <i class="calibre6">man</i> glory in his might, let not the rich <i class="calibre6">man</i> glory in his riches: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <i class="calibre6">things</i> I delight, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <i class="calibre6">them which are</i> circumcised with the uncircumcised; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <i class="calibre6">that are</i> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <i class="calibre6">these</i> nations <i class="calibre6">are</i> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <i class="calibre6">are</i> uncircumcised in the heart.</p></div></body></html>
