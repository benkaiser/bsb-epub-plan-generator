  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job: Why are the Wicked Unpunished</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">Some</i> remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">as</i> wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness <i class="calibre6">yieldeth</i> food for them <i class="calibre6">and</i> for <i class="calibre6">their</i> children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>They reap <i class="calibre6">every one</i> his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that <i class="calibre6">they have</i> no covering in the cold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They cause <i class="calibre6">him</i> to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf <i class="calibre6">from</i> the hungry;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">Which</i> make oil within their walls, <i class="calibre6">and</i> tread <i class="calibre6">their</i> winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly <i class="calibre6">to them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth <i class="calibre6">his</i> face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>In the dark they dig through houses, <i class="calibre6">which</i> they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For the morning <i class="calibre6">is</i> to them even as the shadow of death: if <i class="calibre6">one</i> know <i class="calibre6">them, they are in</i> the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He <i class="calibre6">is</i> swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Drought and heat consume the snow waters: <i class="calibre6">so doth</i> the grave <i class="calibre6">those which</i> have sinned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>He evil entreateth the barren <i class="calibre6">that</i> beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no <i class="calibre6">man</i> is sure of life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span><i class="calibre6">Though</i> it be given him <i class="calibre6">to be</i> in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon their ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all <i class="calibre6">other</i>, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And if <i class="calibre6">it be</i> not <i class="calibre6">so</i> now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p></div></body></html>
