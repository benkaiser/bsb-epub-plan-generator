  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God Remains Faithful<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 147:1-20; Hebrews 10:1-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <i class="calibre6">is there</i> of circumcision? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i class="calibre6">Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) 
<span class="reftext">6</span>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And not <i class="calibre6">rather</i>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="hdg">There is No One Righteous<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 14:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>What then? are we better <i class="calibre6">than they</i>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Their throat <i class="calibre6">is</i> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <i class="calibre6">is</i> under their lips:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Whose mouth <i class="calibre6">is</i> full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Their feet <i class="calibre6">are</i> swift to shed blood:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Destruction and misery <i class="calibre6">are</i> in their ways:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <i class="calibre6">is</i> the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="hdg">Justified by Faith</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Even the righteousness of God <i class="calibre6">which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Whom God hath set forth <i class="calibre6">to be</i> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>To declare, <i class="calibre6">I say</i>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. 
<span class="reftext">29</span><i class="calibre6">Is he</i> the God of the Jews only? <i class="calibre6">is he</i> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Seeing <i class="calibre6">it is</i> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p></div></body></html>
