  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Lord's Sword</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop <i class="calibre6">thy word</i> toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of <i class="calibre6">thy</i> loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak <i class="calibre6">as</i> water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, <i class="calibre6">as</i> every tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon <i class="calibre6">thy</i> thigh. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Because <i class="calibre6">it is</i> a trial, and what if <i class="calibre6">the sword</i> contemn even the rod? it shall be no <i class="calibre6">more</i>, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite <i class="calibre6">thine</i> hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the sword of the great <i class="calibre6">men that are</i> slain, which entereth into their privy chambers. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that <i class="calibre6">their</i> heart may faint, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> ruins be multiplied: ah! <i class="calibre6">it is</i> made bright, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> wrapped up for the slaughter. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Go thee one way or other, <i class="calibre6">either</i> on the right hand, <i class="calibre6">or</i> on the left, whithersoever thy face <i class="calibre6">is</i> set. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose <i class="calibre6">it</i> at the head of the way to the city. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made <i class="calibre6">his</i> arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint <i class="calibre6">battering</i> rams against the gates, to cast a mount, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to build a fort. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, <i class="calibre6">I say</i>, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity <i class="calibre6">shall have</i> an end, 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this <i class="calibre6">shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> the same: exalt <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> low, and abase <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> high. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no <i class="calibre6">more</i>, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it <i class="calibre6">him</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword <i class="calibre6">is</i> drawn: for the slaughter <i class="calibre6">it is</i> furbished, to consume because of the glittering: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <i class="calibre6">shall have</i> an end. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Shall I cause <i class="calibre6">it</i> to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i class="calibre6">and</i> skilful to destroy. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no <i class="calibre6">more</i> remembered: for I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
