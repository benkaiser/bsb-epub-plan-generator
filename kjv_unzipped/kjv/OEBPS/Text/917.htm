  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Four Chariots</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <i class="calibre6">were</i> mountains of brass. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>In the first chariot <i class="calibre6">were</i> red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i class="calibre6">are</i> these, my lord? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the angel answered and said unto me, These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>The black horses which <i class="calibre6">are</i> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Crown and the Temple</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Take of <i class="calibre6">them of</i> the captivity, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set <i class="calibre6">them</i> upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name <i class="calibre6">is</i> The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And they <i class="calibre6">that are</i> far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. And <i class="calibre6">this</i> shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</p></div></body></html>
