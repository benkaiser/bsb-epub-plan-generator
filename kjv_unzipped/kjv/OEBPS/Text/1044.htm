Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Especially <i class="calibre6">because I know</i> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Unto which <i class="calibre6">promise</i> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <i class="calibre6">God</i> day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <i class="calibre6">them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <i class="calibre6">them</i> even unto strange cities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <i class="calibre6">it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Delivering thee from the people, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>To open their eyes, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to turn <i class="calibre6">them</i> from darkness to light, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <i class="calibre6">then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <i class="calibre6">me</i>. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>That Christ should suffer, <i class="calibre6">and</i> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="hdg">Festus Interrupts Paul's Defense</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p></div></body></html>
