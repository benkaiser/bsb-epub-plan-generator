  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Elihu Rebukes Job</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>My words <i class="calibre6">shall be of</i> the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>If thou canst answer me, set <i class="calibre6">thy words</i> in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of <i class="calibre6">thy</i> words, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I am clean without transgression, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> innocent; neither <i class="calibre6">is there</i> iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">in</i> this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For God speaketh once, yea twice, <i class="calibre6">yet man</i> perceiveth it not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>That he may withdraw man <i class="calibre6">from his</i> purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong <i class="calibre6">pain</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones <i class="calibre6">that</i> were not seen stick out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>He looketh upon men, and <i class="calibre6">if any</i> say, I have sinned, and perverted <i class="calibre6">that which was</i> right, and it profited me not;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Lo, all these <i class="calibre6">things</i> worketh God oftentimes with man,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p></div></body></html>
