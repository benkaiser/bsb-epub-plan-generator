  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Warnings about the Adulteress</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Say unto wisdom, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my sister; and call understanding <i class="calibre6">thy</i> kinswoman:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger <i class="calibre6">which</i> flattereth with her words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And, behold, there met him a woman <i class="calibre6">with</i> the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>(She <i class="calibre6">is</i> loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now <i class="calibre6">is she</i> without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>So she caught him, and kissed him, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span><i class="calibre6">I have</i> peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved <i class="calibre6">works</i>, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>For the goodman <i class="calibre6">is</i> not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>He hath taken a bag of money with him, <i class="calibre6">and</i> will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it <i class="calibre6">is</i> for his life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong <i class="calibre6">men</i> have been slain by her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Her house <i class="calibre6">is</i> the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p></div></body></html>
