  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Chambers for the Priests</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the north: and he brought me into the chamber that <i class="calibre6">was</i> over against the separate place, and which <i class="calibre6">was</i> before the building toward the north. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Before the length of an hundred cubits <i class="calibre6">was</i> the north door, and the breadth <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Over against the twenty <i class="calibre6">cubits</i> which <i class="calibre6">were</i> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <i class="calibre6">was</i> for the utter court, <i class="calibre6">was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i class="calibre6">stories</i>. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And before the chambers <i class="calibre6">was</i> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now the upper chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For they <i class="calibre6">were</i> in three <i class="calibre6">stories</i>, but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore <i class="calibre6">the building</i> was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the wall that <i class="calibre6">was</i> without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For the length of the chambers that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the utter court <i class="calibre6">was</i> fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple <i class="calibre6">were</i> an hundred cubits. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And from under these chambers <i class="calibre6">was</i> the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the way before them <i class="calibre6">was</i> like the appearance of the chambers which <i class="calibre6">were</i> toward the north, as long as they, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as broad as they: and all their goings out <i class="calibre6">were</i> both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And according to the doors of the chambers that <i class="calibre6">were</i> toward the south <i class="calibre6">was</i> a door in the head of the way, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then said he unto me, The north chambers <i class="calibre6">and</i> the south chambers, which <i class="calibre6">are</i> before the separate place, they <i class="calibre6">be</i> holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy <i class="calibre6">place</i> into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to <i class="calibre6">those things</i> which <i class="calibre6">are</i> for the people.</p>
<p class="hdg">Outer Measurements</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect <i class="calibre6">is</i> toward the east, and measured it round about. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>He turned about to the west side, <i class="calibre6">and</i> measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred <i class="calibre6">reeds</i> long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.</p></div></body></html>
