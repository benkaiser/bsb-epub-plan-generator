<span class="reftext">2</span>And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i class="calibre6">it seem</i> good unto you, and <i class="calibre6">that it be</i> of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i class="calibre6">that are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i class="calibre6">also</i> to the priests and Levites <i class="calibre6">which are</i> in their cities <i class="calibre6">and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i class="calibre6">that is</i>, to Kirjathjearim, which <i class="calibre6">belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth <i class="calibre6">between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i class="calibre6">on it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And David and all Israel played before God with all <i class="calibre6">their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
<p class="hdg">Uzzah and the Ark<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 6:5-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i class="calibre6">home</i> to me? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>So David brought not the ark <i class="calibre6">home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</p></div></body></html>
