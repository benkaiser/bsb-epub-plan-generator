<span class="reftext">2</span>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <i class="calibre6">whereof</i> to glory; but not before God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Saying</i>, Blessed <i class="calibre6">are</i> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">Cometh</i> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <i class="calibre6">only</i>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i class="calibre6">he had yet</i> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <i class="calibre6">he had</i> being <i class="calibre6">yet</i> uncircumcised.</p>
<p class="hdg">Abraham Receives the Promise<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 15:8-21; Numbers 34:1-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <i class="calibre6">was</i> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For if they which are of the law <i class="calibre6">be</i> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no transgression.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore <i class="calibre6">it is</i> of faith, that <i class="calibre6">it might be</i> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <i class="calibre6">even</i> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him; 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p></div></body></html>
