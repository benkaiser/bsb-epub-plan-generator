<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, <i class="calibre6">yea</i>, my soul and my belly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For I have heard the slander of many: fear <i class="calibre6">was</i> on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>My times <i class="calibre6">are</i> in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, <i class="calibre6">and</i> let them be silent in the grave.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span><i class="calibre6">Oh</i> how great <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; <i class="calibre6">which</i> thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>O love the LORD, all ye his saints: <i class="calibre6">for</i> the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
