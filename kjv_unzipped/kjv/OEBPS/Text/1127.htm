  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Grace and Perseverance<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Hebrews 12:1-3)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i class="calibre6">this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And if a man also strive for masteries, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i class="calibre6">him</i>, we shall also live with <i class="calibre6">him</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i class="calibre6">him</i>: if we deny <i class="calibre6">him</i>, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>If we believe not, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord's Approved Workman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Of these things put <i class="calibre6">them</i> in remembrance, charging <i class="calibre6">them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i class="calibre6">but</i> to the subverting of the hearers. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But shun profane <i class="calibre6">and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, <i class="calibre6">and</i> prepared unto every good work. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, apt to teach, patient, 
<span class="reftext">25</span>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And <i class="calibre6">that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p></div></body></html>
