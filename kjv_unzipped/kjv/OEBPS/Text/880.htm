<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver <i class="calibre6">them</i> up to Edom:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away <i class="calibre6">the punishment</i> thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
