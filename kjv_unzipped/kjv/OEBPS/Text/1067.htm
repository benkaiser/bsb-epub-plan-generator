<span class="reftext">2</span>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i class="calibre6">concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Your glorying <i class="calibre6">is</i> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <i class="calibre6">bread</i> of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Expel the Immoral Brother</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p></div></body></html>
