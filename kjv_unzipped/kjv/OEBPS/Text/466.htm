  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job's Honor Turned into Contempt</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>But now <i class="calibre6">they that are</i> younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Yea, whereto <i class="calibre6">might</i> the strength of their hands <i class="calibre6">profit</i> me, in whom old age was perished?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For want and famine <i class="calibre6">they were</i> solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots <i class="calibre6">for</i> their meat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They were driven forth from among <i class="calibre6">men</i>, (they cried after them as <i class="calibre6">after</i> a thief;)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, <i class="calibre6">in</i> caves of the earth, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the rocks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span><i class="calibre6">They were</i> children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Upon <i class="calibre6">my</i> right <i class="calibre6">hand</i> rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>They came <i class="calibre6">upon me</i> as a wide breaking in <i class="calibre6">of waters</i>: in the desolation they rolled themselves <i class="calibre6">upon me</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Job's Prosperity Becomes Calamity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>By the great force <i class="calibre6">of my disease</i> is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me <i class="calibre6">not</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride <i class="calibre6">upon it</i>, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>For I know <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou wilt bring me <i class="calibre6">to</i> death, and <i class="calibre6">to</i> the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Howbeit he will not stretch out <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was <i class="calibre6">not</i> my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>When I looked for good, then evil came <i class="calibre6">unto me</i>: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, <i class="calibre6">and</i> I cried in the congregation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>My harp also is <i class="calibre6">turned</i> to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</p></div></body></html>
