<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth <i class="calibre6">part</i> of an hin of oil. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the fourth <i class="calibre6">part</i> of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare <i class="calibre6">for</i> a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third <i class="calibre6">part</i> of an hin of oil. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third <i class="calibre6">part</i> of an hin of wine, <i class="calibre6">for</i> a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when thou preparest a bullock <i class="calibre6">for</i> a burnt offering, or <i class="calibre6">for</i> a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, <i class="calibre6">for</i> an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever <i class="calibre6">be</i> among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>One ordinance <i class="calibre6">shall be both</i> for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth <i class="calibre6">with you</i>, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye <i class="calibre6">are</i>, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough <i class="calibre6">for</i> an heave offering: as <i class="calibre6">ye do</i> the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations.</p>
<p class="hdg">Offerings for Unintentional Sins</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

<span class="reftext">24</span>Then it shall be, if <i class="calibre6">ought</i> be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people <i class="calibre6">were</i> in ignorance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, <i class="calibre6">both for</i> him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But the soul that doeth <i class="calibre6">ought</i> presumptuously, <i class="calibre6">whether he be</i> born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon him.</p>

<span class="reftext">33</span>And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Law of Tassels</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<span class="reftext">39</span>And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 
<span class="reftext">40</span>That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God.</p></div></body></html>
