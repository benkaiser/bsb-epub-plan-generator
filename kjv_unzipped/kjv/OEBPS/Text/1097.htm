<span class="reftext">2</span>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Final Warning</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
<p class="hdg">Benediction</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with your spirit. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
