  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Case against Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD'S controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, <i class="calibre6">and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, <i class="calibre6">or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <i class="calibre6">for</i> my transgression, the fruit of my body <i class="calibre6">for</i> the sin of my soul?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He hath shewed thee, O man, what <i class="calibre6">is</i> good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Punishment of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The LORD'S voice crieth unto the city, and <i class="calibre6">the man of</i> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <i class="calibre6">that is</i> abominable?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Shall I count <i class="calibre6">them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <i class="calibre6">is</i> deceitful in their mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore also will I make <i class="calibre6">thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i class="calibre6">thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i class="calibre6">that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p></div></body></html>
