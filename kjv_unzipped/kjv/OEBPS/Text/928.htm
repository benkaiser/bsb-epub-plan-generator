<span class="reftext">2</span>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he shall sit <i class="calibre6">as</i> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in <i class="calibre6">his</i> wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <i class="calibre6">from his right</i>, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="hdg">Robbing God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept <i class="calibre6">them</i>. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, <i class="calibre6">even</i> this whole nation. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that <i class="calibre6">there shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be room</i> enough <i class="calibre6">to receive it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken <i class="calibre6">so much</i> against thee? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Ye have said, It <i class="calibre6">is</i> vain to serve God: and what profit <i class="calibre6">is it</i> that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, <i class="calibre6">they that</i> tempt God are even delivered.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Book of Remembrance</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</p></div></body></html>
