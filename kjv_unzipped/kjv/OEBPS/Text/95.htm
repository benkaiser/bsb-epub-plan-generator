<span class="reftext">2</span>Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether <i class="calibre6">it be</i> a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and <i class="calibre6">if</i> it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness <i class="calibre6">it be</i> that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth <i class="calibre6">of it</i>, then he shall be guilty. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with <i class="calibre6">his</i> lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever <i class="calibre6">it be</i> that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth <i class="calibre6">of it</i>, then he shall be guilty in one of these. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these <i class="calibre6">things</i>, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that <i class="calibre6">thing</i>:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer <i class="calibre6">that</i> which <i class="calibre6">is</i> for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide <i class="calibre6">it</i> asunder: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he shall offer the second <i class="calibre6">for</i> a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put <i class="calibre6">any</i> frankincense thereon: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a memorial thereof, and burn <i class="calibre6">it</i> on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sin offering. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and <i class="calibre6">the remnant</i> shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.</p>
