<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>When thou passest through the waters, I <i class="calibre6">will be</i> with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt <i class="calibre6">for</i> thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Fear not: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Even</i> every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I, <i class="calibre6">even</i> I, <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD; and beside me <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no saviour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no strange <i class="calibre6">god</i> among you: therefore ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yea, before the day <i class="calibre6">was</i> I <i class="calibre6">am</i> he; and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Destruction of Babylon Foretold</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the ships.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.</p>
<p class="hdg">Deliverance for God's People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> rivers in the desert.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I, <i class="calibre6">even</i> I, <i class="calibre6">am</i> he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</p></div></body></html>
