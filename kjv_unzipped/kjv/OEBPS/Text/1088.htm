  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul Defends his Ministry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <i class="calibre6">am</i> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>But I beseech <i class="calibre6">you</i>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>(For the weapons of our warfare <i class="calibre6">are</i> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <i class="calibre6">is</i> Christ's, even so <i class="calibre6">are</i> we Christ's. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For <i class="calibre6">his</i> letters, say they, <i class="calibre6">are</i> weighty and powerful; but <i class="calibre6">his</i> bodily presence <i class="calibre6">is</i> weak, and <i class="calibre6">his</i> speech contemptible. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <i class="calibre6">will we be</i> also in deed when we are present.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But we will not boast of things without <i class="calibre6">our</i> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For we stretch not ourselves beyond <i class="calibre6">our measure</i>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <i class="calibre6">preaching</i> the gospel of Christ: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Not boasting of things without <i class="calibre6">our</i> measure, <i class="calibre6">that is</i>, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>To preach the gospel in the <i class="calibre6">regions</i> beyond you, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</p></div></body></html>
