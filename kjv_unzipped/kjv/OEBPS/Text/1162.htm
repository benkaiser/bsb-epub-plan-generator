  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Children of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</p>
<p class="hdg">Love One Another<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 13:31-35; Romans 12:9-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Not as Cain, <i class="calibre6">who</i> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <i class="calibre6">his</i> brother abideth in death. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Hereby perceive we the love <i class="calibre6">of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i class="calibre6">our</i> lives for the brethren. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i class="calibre6">of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i class="calibre6">then</i> have we confidence toward God. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</p></div></body></html>
