<span class="reftext">2</span>Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him, Put away the strange gods that <i class="calibre6">are</i> among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which <i class="calibre6">were</i> in their hand, and <i class="calibre6">all their</i> earrings which <i class="calibre6">were</i> in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which <i class="calibre6">was</i> by Shechem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that <i class="calibre6">were</i> round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Jacob came to Luz, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the land of Canaan, that <i class="calibre6">is</i>, Bethel, he and all the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jacob is Named Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And God said unto him, Thy name <i class="calibre6">is</i> Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And God said unto him, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Benjamin is Born, Rachel Dies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Bethlehem. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>
