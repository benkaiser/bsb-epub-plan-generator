  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Covenant with David<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 7:4-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD <i class="calibre6">remaineth</i> under curtains. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in thine heart; for God <i class="calibre6">is</i> with thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i class="calibre6">one</i> tabernacle <i class="calibre6">to another</i>. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i class="calibre6">even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the earth. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And since the time that I commanded judges <i class="calibre6">to be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i class="calibre6">to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i class="calibre6">it</i> from <i class="calibre6">him</i> that was before thee: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Prayer<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Samuel 7:18-29)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who <i class="calibre6">am</i> I, O LORD God, and what <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And <i class="calibre6">yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i class="calibre6">also</i> spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>What can David <i class="calibre6">speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i class="calibre6">these</i> great things. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>O LORD, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none like thee, neither <i class="calibre6">is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And what one nation in the earth <i class="calibre6">is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i class="calibre6">to be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> the God of Israel, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a God to Israel: and <i class="calibre6">let</i> the house of David thy servant <i class="calibre6">be</i> established before thee. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i class="calibre6">in his heart</i> to pray before thee. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and <i class="calibre6">it shall be</i> blessed for ever.</p></div></body></html>
