  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Put on the New Self</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>When Christ, <i class="calibre6">who is</i> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And have put on the new <i class="calibre6">man</i>, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <i class="calibre6">nor</i> free: but Christ <i class="calibre6">is</i> all, and in all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also <i class="calibre6">do</i> ye. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And above all these things <i class="calibre6">put on</i> charity, which is the bond of perfectness. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, <i class="calibre6">do</i> all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christian Households</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Husbands, love <i class="calibre6">your</i> wives, and be not bitter against them. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Children, obey <i class="calibre6">your</i> parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Fathers, provoke not your children <i class="calibre6">to anger</i>, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Servants, obey in all things <i class="calibre6">your</i> masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And whatsoever ye do, do <i class="calibre6">it</i> heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p></div></body></html>
