<span class="reftext">2</span>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth <i class="calibre6">upon</i> the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But flesh with the life thereof, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And with every living creature that <i class="calibre6">is</i> with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And God said, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that <i class="calibre6">is</i> with you, for perpetual generations: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And I will remember my covenant, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the earth. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And God said unto Noah, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the earth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah's Sons</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham <i class="calibre6">is</i> the father of Canaan. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah's Shame and Canaan's Curse</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Noah began <i class="calibre6">to be</i> an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces <i class="calibre6">were</i> backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And he said, Cursed <i class="calibre6">be</i> Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.</p>
<p class="hdg">Shem's Blessing and Noah's Death</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And he said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.</p></div></body></html>
