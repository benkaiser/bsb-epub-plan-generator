  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Christ's Eternal Priesthood</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now of the things which we have spoken <i class="calibre6">this is</i> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore <i class="calibre6">it is</i> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>
<p class="hdg">The New Covenant</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For if that first <i class="calibre6">covenant</i> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>In that he saith, A new <i class="calibre6">covenant</i>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old <i class="calibre6">is</i> ready to vanish away.</p></div></body></html>
