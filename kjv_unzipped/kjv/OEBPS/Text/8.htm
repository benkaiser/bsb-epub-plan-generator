<span class="reftext">2</span>The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth <i class="calibre6">month</i>, on the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah Sends a Raven and a Dove</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters <i class="calibre6">were</i> on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth <i class="calibre6">was</i> an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.</p>
<p class="hdg">Exiting the Ark</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first <i class="calibre6">month</i>, the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Bring forth with thee every living thing that <i class="calibre6">is</i> with thee, of all flesh, <i class="calibre6">both</i> of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, <i class="calibre6">and</i> whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</p>
<p class="hdg">Noah Builds an Altar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart <i class="calibre6">is</i> evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.</p></div></body></html>
