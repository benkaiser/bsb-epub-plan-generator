  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">War with the Philistines</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Saul chose him three thousand <i class="calibre6">men</i> of Israel; <i class="calibre6">whereof</i> two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that <i class="calibre6">was</i> in Geba, and the Philistines heard <i class="calibre6">of it</i>. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And all Israel heard say <i class="calibre6">that</i> Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And <i class="calibre6">some of</i> the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he <i class="calibre6">was</i> yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</p>
<p class="hdg">Saul's Unlawful Sacrifice</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel <i class="calibre6">had appointed</i>: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
<p class="hdg">Samuel Rebukes Saul</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou camest not within the days appointed, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him <i class="calibre6">to be</i> captain over his people, because thou hast not kept <i class="calibre6">that</i> which the LORD commanded thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people <i class="calibre6">that were</i> present with him, about six hundred men.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philistines Raid Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people <i class="calibre6">that were</i> present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way <i class="calibre6">that leadeth to</i> Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And another company turned the way <i class="calibre6">to</i> Bethhoron: and another company turned <i class="calibre6">to</i> the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel without Weapons</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make <i class="calibre6">them</i> swords or spears: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.</p></div></body></html>
