  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Mourning and Burial for Jacob</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> beyond Jordan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph Comforts his Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we <i class="calibre6">be</i> thy servants. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for <i class="calibre6">am</i> I in the place of God? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But as for you, ye thought evil against me; <i class="calibre6">but</i> God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as <i class="calibre6">it is</i> this day, to save much people alive. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Death of Joseph</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third <i class="calibre6">generation</i>: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>So Joseph died, <i class="calibre6">being</i> an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p></div></body></html>
