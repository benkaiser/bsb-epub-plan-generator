<span class="reftext">2</span>If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ) 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And to make all <i class="calibre6">men</i> see what <i class="calibre6">is</i> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <i class="calibre6">places</i> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Prayer for the Ephesians</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>May be able to comprehend with all saints what <i class="calibre6">is</i> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Unto him <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
