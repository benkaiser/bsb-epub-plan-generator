  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greeting to Gaius from the Elder<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 John 1:1-3)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Gaius' Example of Hospitality</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Diotrephes and Demetrius</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <i class="calibre6">them</i> out of the church.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Demetrius hath good report of all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, and of the truth itself: yea, and we <i class="calibre6">also</i> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p class="hdg">Conclusion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> to thee. <i class="calibre6">Our</i> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p></div></body></html>
