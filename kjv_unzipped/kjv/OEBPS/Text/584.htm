O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i class="calibre6">he is</i> good: for his mercy <i class="calibre6">endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? <i class="calibre6">who</i> can shew forth all his praise?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">are</i> they that keep judgment, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Remember me, O LORD, with the favour <i class="calibre6">that thou bearest unto</i> thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked <i class="calibre6">him</i> at the sea, <i class="calibre6">even</i> at the Red sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>They envied Moses also in the camp, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Aaron the saint of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, <i class="calibre6">and</i> terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>But murmured in their tents, <i class="calibre6">and</i> hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Thus they provoked <i class="calibre6">him</i> to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and <i class="calibre6">so</i> the plague was stayed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>They angered <i class="calibre6">him</i> also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And shed innocent blood, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked <i class="calibre6">him</i> with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
