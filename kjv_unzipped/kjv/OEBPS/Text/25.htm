<span class="reftext">2</span>And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these <i class="calibre6">were</i> the children of Keturah. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>

<span class="reftext">9</span>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Mamre; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Descendants of Ishmael</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

<span class="reftext">17</span>And these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: <i class="calibre6">and</i> he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>

<span class="reftext">20</span>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she <i class="calibre6">was</i> barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If <i class="calibre6">it be</i> so, why <i class="calibre6">am</i> I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And the LORD said unto her, Two nations <i class="calibre6">are</i> in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and <i class="calibre6">the one</i> people shall be stronger than <i class="calibre6">the other</i> people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, <i class="calibre6">there were</i> twins in her womb. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac <i class="calibre6">was</i> threescore years old when she bare them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob <i class="calibre6">was</i> a plain man, dwelling in tents. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of <i class="calibre6">his</i> venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<p class="hdg">Esau Sells his Birthright</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he <i class="calibre6">was</i> faint: 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red <i class="calibre6">pottage</i>; for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And Esau said, Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised <i class="calibre6">his</i> birthright.</p></div></body></html>
