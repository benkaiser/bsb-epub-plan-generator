David the son of Jesse said, and the man <i class="calibre6">who was</i> raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <i class="calibre6">was</i> in my tongue.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <i class="calibre6">must be</i> just, ruling in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And <i class="calibre6">he shall be</i> as the light of the morning, <i class="calibre6">when</i> the sun riseth, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a morning without clouds; <i class="calibre6">as</i> the tender grass <i class="calibre6">springing</i> out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Although my house <i class="calibre6">be</i> not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all <i class="calibre6">things</i>, and sure: for <i class="calibre6">this is</i> all my salvation, and all <i class="calibre6">my</i> desire, although he make <i class="calibre6">it</i> not to grow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>But <i class="calibre6">the sons</i> of Belial <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the man <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the <i class="calibre6">same</i> place.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Mighty Men<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Chronicles 11:10-19; 1 Chronicles 11:20-47)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>These <i class="calibre6">be</i> the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same <i class="calibre6">was</i> Adino the Eznite: <i class="calibre6">he lift up his spear</i> against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And after him <i class="calibre6">was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, <i class="calibre6">one</i> of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines <i class="calibre6">that</i> were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And after him <i class="calibre6">was</i> Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And David <i class="calibre6">was</i> then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines <i class="calibre6">was</i> then <i class="calibre6">in</i> Bethlehem. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the gate! 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that <i class="calibre6">was</i> by the gate, and took <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and brought <i class="calibre6">it</i> to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: <i class="calibre6">is not this</i> the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, <i class="calibre6">and</i> slew <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and had the name among three. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the <i class="calibre6">first</i> three.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>These <i class="calibre6">things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the <i class="calibre6">first</i> three. And David set him over his guard.</p>
