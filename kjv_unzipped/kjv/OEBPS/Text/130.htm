<span class="reftext">2</span>Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men <i class="calibre6">were</i> heads of the children of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And these <i class="calibre6">were</i> their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Of the tribe of Joseph, <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</p>
<p class="hdg">Instructions to the Spies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this <i class="calibre6">way</i> southward, and go up into the mountain: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And see the land, what it <i class="calibre6">is</i>; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they <i class="calibre6">be</i> strong or weak, few or many; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And what the land <i class="calibre6">is</i> that they dwell in, whether it <i class="calibre6">be</i> good or bad; and what cities <i class="calibre6">they be</i> that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And what the land <i class="calibre6">is</i>, whether it <i class="calibre6">be</i> fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time <i class="calibre6">was</i> the time of the firstripe grapes.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Spies Explore Canaan</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, <i class="calibre6">were</i>. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and <i class="calibre6">they brought</i> of the pomegranates, and of the figs. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Reports of the Spies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the fruit of it. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Nevertheless the people <i class="calibre6">be</i> strong that dwell in the land, and the cities <i class="calibre6">are</i> walled, <i class="calibre6">and</i> very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> stronger than we. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, <i class="calibre6">is</i> a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it <i class="calibre6">are</i> men of a great stature. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, <i class="calibre6">which come</i> of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p></div></body></html>
