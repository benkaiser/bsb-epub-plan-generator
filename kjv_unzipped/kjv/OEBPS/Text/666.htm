  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Value of Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>A good name <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that <i class="calibre6">is</i> the end of all men; and the living will lay <i class="calibre6">it</i> to his heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Sorrow <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The heart of the wise <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the house of mirth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <i class="calibre6">is</i> the laughter of the fool: this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Better <i class="calibre6">is</i> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <i class="calibre6">and</i> the patient in spirit <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than the proud in spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Say not thou, What is <i class="calibre6">the cause</i> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Wisdom <i class="calibre6">is</i> good with an inheritance: and <i class="calibre6">by it there is</i> profit to them that see the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For wisdom <i class="calibre6">is</i> a defence, <i class="calibre6">and</i> money <i class="calibre6">is</i> a defence: but the excellency of knowledge <i class="calibre6">is, that</i> wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Consider the work of God: for who can make <i class="calibre6">that</i> straight, which he hath made crooked?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Limits of Human Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>All <i class="calibre6">things</i> have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just <i class="calibre6">man</i> that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked <i class="calibre6">man</i> that prolongeth <i class="calibre6">his life</i> in his wickedness. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? 
<span class="reftext">18</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty <i class="calibre6">men</i> which are in the city. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For <i class="calibre6">there is</i> not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee: 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it <i class="calibre6">was</i> far from me. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason <i class="calibre6">of things</i>, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness <i class="calibre6">and</i> madness: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <i class="calibre6">is</i> snares and nets, <i class="calibre6">and</i> her hands <i class="calibre6">as</i> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, <i class="calibre6">counting</i> one by one, to find out the account: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</p></div></body></html>
