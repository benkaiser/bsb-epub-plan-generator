<span class="reftext">3</span>And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,

<span class="reftext">5</span>And in cutting of stones, to set <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that <i class="calibre6">is</i> thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,

<span class="reftext">14</span>Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth <i class="calibre6">any</i> work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Six days may work be done; but in the seventh <i class="calibre6">is</i> the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth <i class="calibre6">any</i> work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
