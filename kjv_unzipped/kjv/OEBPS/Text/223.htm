<span class="reftext">2</span>And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when I saw that ye delivered <i class="calibre6">me</i> not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites <i class="calibre6">are</i> fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, <i class="calibre6">and</i> among the Manassites. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was <i class="calibre6">so</i>, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, <i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce <i class="calibre6">it</i> right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in <i class="calibre6">one of</i> the cities of Gilead.</p>
<p class="hdg">Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, <i class="calibre6">whom</i> he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.</p></div></body></html>
