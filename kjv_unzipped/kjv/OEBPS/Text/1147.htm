  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings from James<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Jude 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="hdg">Rejoicing in Trials<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Philippians 1:12-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Knowing <i class="calibre6">this</i>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But let patience have <i class="calibre6">her</i> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i class="calibre6">men</i> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>A double minded man <i class="calibre6">is</i> unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="hdg">Contrast of the Rich and Poor</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Perseverance in Temptation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Do not err, my beloved brethren. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="hdg">Hearing and Doing</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <i class="calibre6">therein</i>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion <i class="calibre6">is</i> vain. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p></div></body></html>
