  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jonah Preaches to the Ninevites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days' journey. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>
<p class="hdg">Nineveh Repents</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i class="calibre6">him</i> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he caused <i class="calibre6">it</i> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in their hands. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Who can tell <i class="calibre6">if</i> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i class="calibre6">it</i> not.</p></div></body></html>
