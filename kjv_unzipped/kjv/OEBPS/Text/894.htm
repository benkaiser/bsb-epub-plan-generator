  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment against Israel<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 7:17-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as the waters <i class="calibre6">that are</i> poured down a steep place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For the transgression of Jacob <i class="calibre6">is</i> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <i class="calibre6">is</i> the transgression of Jacob? <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not Samaria? and what <i class="calibre6">are</i> the high places of Judah? <i class="calibre6">are they</i> not Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <i class="calibre6">it</i> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</p>
<p class="hdg">Weeping and Mourning</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For her wound <i class="calibre6">is</i> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Declare ye <i class="calibre6">it</i> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <i class="calibre6">is</i> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the houses of Achzib <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</p></div></body></html>
