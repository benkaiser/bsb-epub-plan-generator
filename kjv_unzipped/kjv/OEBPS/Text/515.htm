  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Don't Fret Because of Evildoers<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Kings 2:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span><i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of David. Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Trust in the LORD, and do good; <i class="calibre6">so</i> shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring <i class="calibre6">it</i> to pass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For yet a little while, and the wicked <i class="calibre6">shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i>: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it <i class="calibre6">shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to slay such as be of upright conversation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>A little that a righteous man hath <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than the riches of many wicked.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For <i class="calibre6">such as be</i> blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and <i class="calibre6">they that be</i> cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>The steps of a <i class="calibre6">good</i> man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth <i class="calibre6">him with</i> his hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I have been young, and <i class="calibre6">now</i> am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span><i class="calibre6">He is</i> ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed <i class="calibre6">is</i> blessed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>The law of his God <i class="calibre6">is</i> in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Yet he passed away, and, lo, he <i class="calibre6">was</i> not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>Mark the perfect <i class="calibre6">man</i>, and behold the upright: for the end of <i class="calibre6">that</i> man <i class="calibre6">is</i> peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>But the salvation of the righteous <i class="calibre6">is</i> of the LORD: <i class="calibre6">he is</i> their strength in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</p></div></body></html>
