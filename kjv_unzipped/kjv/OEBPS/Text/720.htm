  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Help to Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew <i class="calibre6">their</i> strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Who raised up the righteous <i class="calibre6">man</i> from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made <i class="calibre6">him</i> rule over kings? he gave <i class="calibre6">them</i> as the dust to his sword, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as driven stubble to his bow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>He pursued them, <i class="calibre6">and</i> passed safely; <i class="calibre6">even</i> by the way <i class="calibre6">that</i> he had not gone with his feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who hath wrought and done <i class="calibre6">it</i>, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I <i class="calibre6">am</i> he.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The isles saw <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>They helped every one his neighbour; and <i class="calibre6">every one</i> said to his brother, Be of good courage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, <i class="calibre6">and</i> he that smootheth <i class="calibre6">with</i> the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It <i class="calibre6">is</i> ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, <i class="calibre6">that</i> it should not be moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But thou, Israel, <i class="calibre6">art</i> my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">Thou</i> whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Fear thou not; for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> with thee: be not dismayed; for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, <i class="calibre6">and</i> ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat <i class="calibre6">them</i> small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, <i class="calibre6">and</i> shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span><i class="calibre6">When</i> the poor and needy seek water, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none, <i class="calibre6">and</i> their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, <i class="calibre6">I</i> the God of Israel will not forsake them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the pine, and the box tree together:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</p>
<p class="hdg">Meaningless Idols</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong <i class="calibre6">reasons</i>, saith the King of Jacob.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Let them bring <i class="calibre6">them</i> forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they <i class="calibre6">be</i>, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold <i class="calibre6">it</i> together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Behold, ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination <i class="calibre6">is he that</i> chooseth you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>I have raised up <i class="calibre6">one</i> from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as <i class="calibre6">upon</i> morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, <i class="calibre6">He is</i> righteous? yea, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none that sheweth, yea, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none that declareth, yea, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none that heareth your words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>The first <i class="calibre6">shall say</i> to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For I beheld, and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no man; even among them, and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no counseller, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Behold, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> all vanity; their works <i class="calibre6">are</i> nothing: their molten images <i class="calibre6">are</i> wind and confusion.</p></div></body></html>
