  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Freedom in Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>This persuasion <i class="calibre6">cometh</i> not of him that calleth you. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <i class="calibre6">use</i> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i class="calibre6">even</i> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p class="hdg">Living by the Spirit<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 8:9-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">This</i> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <i class="calibre6">these</i>; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <i class="calibre6">you</i> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p></div></body></html>
