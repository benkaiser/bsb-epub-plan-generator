  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Overthrow of Nineveh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition, watch the way, make <i class="calibre6">thy</i> loins strong, fortify <i class="calibre6">thy</i> power mightily.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men <i class="calibre6">are</i> in scarlet: the chariots <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead <i class="calibre6">her</i> as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But Nineveh <i class="calibre6">is</i> of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, <i class="calibre6">shall they cry</i>; but none shall look back.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none end of the store <i class="calibre6">and</i> glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and much pain <i class="calibre6">is</i> in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the old lion, walked, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the lion's whelp, and none made <i class="calibre6">them</i> afraid?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p></div></body></html>
