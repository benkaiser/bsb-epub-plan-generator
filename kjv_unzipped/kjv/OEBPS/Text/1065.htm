  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul and Apollos God's Fellow Workers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <i class="calibre6">even</i> as unto babes in Christ. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <i class="calibre6">to bear it</i>, neither yet now are ye able. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i class="calibre6">there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Who then is Paul, and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, <i class="calibre6">ye are</i> God's building.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ the Only Foundation<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 28:14-22; 1 Peter 2:4-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
<p class="hdg">You are God's Temple<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 12:1-8; 1 Corinthians 6:18-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <i class="calibre6">temple</i> ye are.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>
<p class="hdg">Worldly Wisdom is Foolishness to God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And ye are Christ's; and Christ <i class="calibre6">is</i> God's.</p></div></body></html>
