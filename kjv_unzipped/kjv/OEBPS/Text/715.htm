  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Sennacherib Invades Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, <i class="calibre6">that</i> Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i class="calibre6">is</i> this wherein thou trustest? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>I say, <i class="calibre6">sayest thou</i>, (but <i class="calibre6">they are but</i> vain words) <i class="calibre6">I have</i> counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i class="calibre6">is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i class="calibre6">it</i>: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that <i class="calibre6">are</i> on the wall. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? <i class="calibre6">hath he</i> not <i class="calibre6">sent me</i> to the men that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make <i class="calibre6">an agreement</i> with me <i class="calibre6">by</i> a present, and come out to me: and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
<span class="reftext">18</span><i class="calibre6">Beware</i> lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Where <i class="calibre6">are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <i class="calibre6">are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Who <i class="calibre6">are they</i> among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with <i class="calibre6">their</i> clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</p></div></body></html>
