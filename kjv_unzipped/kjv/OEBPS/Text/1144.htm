  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Faith is Being Sure</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of Abel, Enoch, Noah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But without faith <i class="calibre6">it is</i> impossible to please <i class="calibre6">him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of Abraham<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 15:1-7; Romans 4:1-12; Galatians 3:1-9; James 2:14-26)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <i class="calibre6">in</i> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <i class="calibre6">is</i> God. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <i class="calibre6">so many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and embraced <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And truly, if they had been mindful of that <i class="calibre6">country</i> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But now they desire a better <i class="calibre6">country</i>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i class="calibre6">son</i>, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Accounting that God <i class="calibre6">was</i> able to raise <i class="calibre6">him</i> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of Isaac, Jacob, Joseph</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <i class="calibre6">leaning</i> upon the top of his staff. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of Moses</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i class="calibre6">he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <i class="calibre6">land</i>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of Many<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Joshua 2:1-14)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> Barak, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> Samson, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> Jephthae; <i class="calibre6">of</i> David also, and Samuel, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> the prophets: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And others had trial of <i class="calibre6">cruel</i> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: 
<span class="reftext">37</span>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; 
<span class="reftext">38</span>(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> mountains, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> dens and caves of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: 
<span class="reftext">40</span>God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p></div></body></html>
