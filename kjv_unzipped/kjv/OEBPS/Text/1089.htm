  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul and the False Apostles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <i class="calibre6">my</i> folly: and indeed bear with me. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i class="calibre6">you as</i> a chaste virgin to Christ. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <i class="calibre6">if</i> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <i class="calibre6">him</i>. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But though <i class="calibre6">I be</i> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>I robbed other churches, taking wages <i class="calibre6">of them</i>, to do you service. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <i class="calibre6">things</i> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <i class="calibre6">so</i> will I keep <i class="calibre6">myself</i>. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For such <i class="calibre6">are</i> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Therefore <i class="calibre6">it is</i> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Sufferings and Service<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Colossians 1:24-29)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>That which I speak, I speak <i class="calibre6">it</i> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <i class="calibre6">yourselves</i> are wise. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <i class="calibre6">you</i>, if a man take <i class="calibre6">of you</i>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Are they Hebrews? so <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. Are they Israelites? so <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <i class="calibre6">am</i> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Of the Jews five times received I forty <i class="calibre6">stripes</i> save one. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
<span class="reftext">26</span><i class="calibre6">In</i> journeyings often, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils of waters, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils of robbers, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils by <i class="calibre6">mine own</i> countrymen, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils by the heathen, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils in the city, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils in the sea, <i class="calibre6">in</i> perils among false brethren; 
<span class="reftext">27</span>In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</p></div></body></html>
