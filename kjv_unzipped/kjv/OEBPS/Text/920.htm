<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Ashkelon shall see <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and fear; Gaza also <i class="calibre6">shall see it</i>, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> from sea <i class="calibre6">even</i> to sea, and from the river <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein <i class="calibre6">is</i> no water.</p>
