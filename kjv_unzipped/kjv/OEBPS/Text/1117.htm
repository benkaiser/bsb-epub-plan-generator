<span class="reftext">4</span>So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ's Coming</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span><i class="calibre6">Which is</i> a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Seeing <i class="calibre6">it is</i> a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, 
<span class="reftext">8</span>In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of <i class="calibre6">this</i> calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of <i class="calibre6">his</i> goodness, and the work of faith with power: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p></div></body></html>
