<span class="reftext">2</span>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD, 
<span class="reftext">3</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> to speak unto the priests which <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh <i class="calibre6">month</i>, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to me? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat <i class="calibre6">for yourselves</i>, and drink <i class="calibre6">for yourselves</i>? 
<span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Should ye</i> not <i class="calibre6">hear</i> the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when <i class="calibre6">men</i> inhabited the south and the plain?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Yea, they made their hearts <i class="calibre6">as</i> an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore it is come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</p></div></body></html>
