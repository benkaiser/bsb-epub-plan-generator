  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jerusalem the Useless Vine</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, <i class="calibre6">or than</i> a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <i class="calibre6">men</i> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for <i class="calibre6">any</i> work? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for <i class="calibre6">any</i> work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from <i class="calibre6">one</i> fire, and <i class="calibre6">another</i> fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, when I set my face against them. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.</p></div></body></html>
