  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus the Good Shepherd<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 23:1-6; Ezekiel 34:11-24)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have <i class="calibre6">it</i> more abundantly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I am the good shepherd, and know my <i class="calibre6">sheep</i>, and am known of mine. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, <i class="calibre6">and</i> one shepherd. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Unbelief of the Jews</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any <i class="calibre6">man</i> pluck them out of my hand. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>My Father, which gave <i class="calibre6">them</i> me, is greater than all; and no <i class="calibre6">man</i> is able to pluck <i class="calibre6">them</i> out of my Father's hand. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>I and <i class="calibre6">my</i> Father are one.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 
<span class="reftext">33</span>The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 
<span class="reftext">37</span>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father <i class="calibre6">is</i> in me, and I in him. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,</p>
<p class="hdg">Many across the Jordan Believe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And many believed on him there.</p></div></body></html>
