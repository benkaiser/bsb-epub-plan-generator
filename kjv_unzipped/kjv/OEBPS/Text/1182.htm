<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <i class="calibre6">and</i> over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy ways, thou King of saints.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for <i class="calibre6">thou</i> only <i class="calibre6">art</i> holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p></div></body></html>
