  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judah and Tamar<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Chronicles 2:3-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Hirah. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Tamar. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled <i class="calibre6">it</i> on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren <i class="calibre6">did</i>. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>When Judah saw her, he thought her <i class="calibre6">to be</i> an harlot; because she had covered her face. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she <i class="calibre6">was</i> his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said, I will send <i class="calibre6">thee</i> a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give <i class="calibre6">me</i> a pledge, till thou send <i class="calibre6">it</i>? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in thine hand. And he gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive <i class="calibre6">his</i> pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the harlot, that <i class="calibre6">was</i> openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this <i class="calibre6">place</i>. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, <i class="calibre6">that</i> there was no harlot in this <i class="calibre6">place</i>. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Judah said, Let her take <i class="calibre6">it</i> to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she <i class="calibre6">is</i> with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>When she <i class="calibre6">was</i> brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these <i class="calibre6">are, am</i> I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose <i class="calibre6">are</i> these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And Judah acknowledged <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Birth of Pharez and Zarah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins <i class="calibre6">were</i> in her womb. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that <i class="calibre6">the one</i> put out <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? <i class="calibre6">this</i> breach <i class="calibre6">be</i> upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p></div></body></html>
