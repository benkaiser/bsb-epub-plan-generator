<p class="hdg">The Returning Priests</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

<span class="reftext">18</span>Who hitherto <i class="calibre6">waited</i> in the king's gate eastward: they <i class="calibre6">were</i> porters in the companies of the children of Levi. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, <i class="calibre6">were</i> over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, <i class="calibre6">being</i> over the host of the LORD, <i class="calibre6">were</i> keepers of the entry. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the LORD <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him.

<span class="reftext">24</span>In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And their brethren, <i class="calibre6">which were</i> in their villages, <i class="calibre6">were</i> to come after seven days from time to time with them. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in <i class="calibre6">their</i> set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon them, and the opening thereof every morning <i class="calibre6">pertained</i> to them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And <i class="calibre6">certain</i> of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. 
<span class="reftext">29</span><i class="calibre6">Some</i> of them also <i class="calibre6">were</i> appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And Mattithiah, <i class="calibre6">one</i> of the Levites, who <i class="calibre6">was</i> the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And <i class="calibre6">other</i> of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, <i class="calibre6">were</i> over the shewbread, to prepare <i class="calibre6">it</i> every sabbath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, <i class="calibre6">who remaining</i> in the chambers <i class="calibre6">were</i> free: for they were employed in <i class="calibre6">that</i> work day and night. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>These chief fathers of the Levites <i class="calibre6">were</i> chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>

<span class="reftext">37</span>And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And the son of Jonathan <i class="calibre6">was</i> Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And the sons of Micah <i class="calibre6">were</i>, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, <i class="calibre6">and Ahaz</i>. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And Azel had six sons, whose names <i class="calibre6">are</i> these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these <i class="calibre6">were</i> the sons of Azel.</p></div></body></html>
