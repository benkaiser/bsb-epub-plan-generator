<span class="reftext">2</span>And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Hear us, my lord: thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to the children of Heth. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou <i class="calibre6">wilt give it</i>, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take <i class="calibre6">it</i> of me, and I will bury my dead there. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>My lord, hearken unto me: the land <i class="calibre6">is worth</i> four hundred shekels of silver; what <i class="calibre6">is</i> that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current <i class="calibre6">money</i> with the merchant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the field of Ephron, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> in Machpelah, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> before Mamre, the field, and the cave which <i class="calibre6">was</i> therein, and all the trees that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the field, that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in all the borders round about, were made sure 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> Hebron in the land of Canaan. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the field, and the cave that <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</p></div></body></html>
