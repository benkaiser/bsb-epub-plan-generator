  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <i class="calibre6">as</i> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And though I have <i class="calibre6">the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i class="calibre6">the poor</i>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Charity suffereth long, <i class="calibre6">and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Charity never faileth: but whether <i class="calibre6">there be</i> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <i class="calibre6">there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i class="calibre6">there be</i> knowledge, it shall vanish away. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i class="calibre6">is</i> charity.</p></div></body></html>
