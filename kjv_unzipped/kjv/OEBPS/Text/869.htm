  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Ephraim's Iniquity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the troop of robbers spoileth without.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And they consider not in their hearts <i class="calibre6">that</i> I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, <i class="calibre6">who</i> ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>In the day of our king the princes have made <i class="calibre6">him</i> sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none among them that calleth unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth <i class="calibre6">it</i> not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, <i class="calibre6">and</i> they rebel against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Though I have bound <i class="calibre6">and</i> strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>They return, <i class="calibre6">but</i> not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> their derision in the land of Egypt.</p></div></body></html>
