  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Obedience to Authorities</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i class="calibre6">but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Mercy to Us</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i class="calibre6">and</i> hating one another. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 
<span class="reftext">8</span><i class="calibre6">This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="hdg">Avoiding Divisions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Remarks and Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you all. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
