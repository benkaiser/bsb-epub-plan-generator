<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that <i class="calibre6">are</i> on the earth. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, <i class="calibre6">and</i> cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: <i class="calibre6">as</i> the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean unto you. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean unto you. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean unto you. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <i class="calibre6">is</i> unclean to you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean to you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>These shall ye eat of all that <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the waters, they <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> an abomination unto you: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And these <i class="calibre6">are they which</i> ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Every raven after his kind;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>All fowls that creep, going upon <i class="calibre6">all</i> four, <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> an abomination unto you. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon <i class="calibre6">all</i> four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 
<span class="reftext">22</span><i class="calibre6">Even</i> these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But all <i class="calibre6">other</i> flying creeping things, which have four feet, <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> an abomination unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And whosoever beareth <i class="calibre6">ought</i> of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
<span class="reftext">26</span><i class="calibre6">The carcases</i> of every beast which divideth the hoof, and <i class="calibre6">is</i> not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on <i class="calibre6">all</i> four, those <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>These also <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And upon whatsoever <i class="calibre6">any</i> of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether <i class="calibre6">it be</i> any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel <i class="calibre6">it be</i>, wherein <i class="calibre6">any</i> work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And every earthen vessel, whereinto <i class="calibre6">any</i> of them falleth, whatsoever <i class="calibre6">is</i> in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Of all meat which may be eaten, <i class="calibre6">that</i> on which <i class="calibre6">such</i> water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every <i class="calibre6">such</i> vessel shall be unclean. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And every <i class="calibre6">thing</i> whereupon <i class="calibre6">any part</i> of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; <i class="calibre6">whether it be</i> oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: <i class="calibre6">for</i> they <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean, and shall be unclean unto you. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Nevertheless a fountain or pit, <i class="calibre6">wherein there is</i> plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And if <i class="calibre6">any part</i> of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> clean. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>But if <i class="calibre6">any</i> water be put upon the seed, and <i class="calibre6">any part</i> of their carcase fall thereon, it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> unclean unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon <i class="calibre6">all</i> four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> an abomination. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>For I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>For I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> holy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 
<span class="reftext">47</span>To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.</p></div></body></html>
