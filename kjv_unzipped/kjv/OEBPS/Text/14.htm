<span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">That these</i> made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.</p>
<p class="hdg">Lot Seized by the Four Kings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the vale of Siddim <i class="calibre6">was full of</i> slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>
<p class="hdg">Abram Rescues Lot</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these <i class="calibre6">were</i> confederate with Abram. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained <i class="calibre6">servants</i>, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto Dan. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the left hand of Damascus. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.</p>

<span class="reftext">18</span>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he <i class="calibre6">was</i> the priest of the most high God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And he blessed him, and said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>That I will not <i class="calibre6">take</i> from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that <i class="calibre6">is</i> thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.</p></div></body></html>
