Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers <i class="calibre6">that</i> water the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and <i class="calibre6">him</i> that hath no helper.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; <i class="calibre6">and</i> daily shall he be praised.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and <i class="calibre6">they</i> of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and <i class="calibre6">men</i> shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.</p>
