  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Doomed Flock</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And I will feed the flock of slaughter, <i class="calibre6">even</i> you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.</p>
<p class="hdg">Thirty Pieces of Silver<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 26:14-16; Matthew 27:3-10; Mark 14:10-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And I took my staff, <i class="calibre6">even</i> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <i class="calibre6">was</i> the word of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give <i class="calibre6">me</i> my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty <i class="calibre6">pieces</i> of silver. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty <i class="calibre6">pieces</i> of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then I cut asunder mine other staff, <i class="calibre6">even</i> Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</p></div></body></html>
