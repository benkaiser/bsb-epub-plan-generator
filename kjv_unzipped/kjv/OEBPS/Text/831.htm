  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment against Pharaoh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>In the tenth year, in the tenth <i class="calibre6">month</i>, in the twelfth <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Speak, and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine own, and I have made <i class="calibre6">it</i> for myself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And I will leave thee <i class="calibre6">thrown</i> into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break, and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou brakest, and madest all their loins to be at a stand.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Desolation of Egypt</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast out of thee. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD: because he hath said, The river <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine, and I have made <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Behold, therefore I <i class="calibre6">am</i> against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste <i class="calibre6">and</i> desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <i class="calibre6">that are</i> desolate, and her cities among the cities <i class="calibre6">that are</i> laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return <i class="calibre6">into</i> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth <i class="calibre6">their</i> iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Egypt the Reward of Nebuchadnezzar</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <i class="calibre6">month</i>, in the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <i class="calibre6">was</i> made bald, and every shoulder <i class="calibre6">was</i> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>I have given him the land of Egypt <i class="calibre6">for</i> his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
