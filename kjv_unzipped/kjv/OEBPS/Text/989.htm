  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Unrighteous Steward</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>So he called every one of his lord's debtors <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true <i class="calibre6">riches</i>? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Law and the Prophets<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 11:7-19; Luke 1:5-25; Luke 7:24-35)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The law and the prophets <i class="calibre6">were</i> until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</p>

<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 5:39-47)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that <i class="calibre6">would come</i> from thence. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p></div></body></html>
