<span class="reftext">2</span>And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top <i class="calibre6">may reach</i> unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD said, Behold, the people <i class="calibre6">is</i> one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Genealogy from Shem to Abram</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the generations of Shem: Shem <i class="calibre6">was</i> an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

<span class="reftext">29</span>And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife <i class="calibre6">was</i> Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But Sarai was barren; she <i class="calibre6">had</i> no child.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p></div></body></html>
