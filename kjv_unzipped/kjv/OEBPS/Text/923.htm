<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah <i class="calibre6">and</i> against Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, <i class="calibre6">even</i> in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify <i class="calibre6">themselves</i> against Judah. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> as God, as the angel of the LORD before them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</p>

<span class="reftext">11</span>In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.</p></div></body></html>
