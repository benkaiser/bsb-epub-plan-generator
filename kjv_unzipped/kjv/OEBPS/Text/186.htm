  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Majesty of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand <i class="calibre6">went</i> a fiery law for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i class="calibre6">are</i> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <i class="calibre6">every one</i> shall receive of thy words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Moses commanded us a law, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people <i class="calibre6">and</i> the tribes of Israel were gathered together.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Blessings of the Twelve Tribes</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let Reuben live, and not die; and let <i class="calibre6">not</i> his men be few.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is the blessing</i> of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help <i class="calibre6">to him</i> from his enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And of Levi he said, <i class="calibre6">Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i class="calibre6">be</i> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <i class="calibre6">and with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; <i class="calibre6">and the LORD</i> shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD <i class="calibre6">be</i> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And for the precious fruits <i class="calibre6">brought forth</i> by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let <i class="calibre6">the blessing</i> come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him <i class="calibre6">that was</i> separated from his brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>His glory <i class="calibre6">is like</i> the firstling of his bullock, and his horns <i class="calibre6">are like</i> the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the thousands of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck <i class="calibre6">of</i> the abundance of the seas, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> treasures hid in the sand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And of Gad he said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, <i class="calibre6">in</i> a portion of the lawgiver, <i class="calibre6">was he</i> seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And of Dan he said, Dan <i class="calibre6">is</i> a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And of Asher he said, <i class="calibre6">Let</i> Asher <i class="calibre6">be</i> blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Thy shoes <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> iron and brass; and as thy days, <i class="calibre6">so shall</i> thy strength <i class="calibre6">be</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Excellence of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> none like unto the God of Jeshurun, <i class="calibre6">who</i> rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>The eternal God <i class="calibre6">is thy</i> refuge, and underneath <i class="calibre6">are</i> the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Happy <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou, O Israel: who <i class="calibre6">is</i> like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.</p></div></body></html>
