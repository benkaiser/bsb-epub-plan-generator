  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Judgment on the Ammonites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why <i class="calibre6">then</i> doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <i class="calibre6">and</i> his priests and his princes together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Who shall come unto me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Edom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; <i class="calibre6">Is</i> wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will visit him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave <i class="calibre6">some</i> gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he <i class="calibre6">is</i> not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve <i class="calibre6">them</i> alive; and let thy widows trust in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment <i class="calibre6">was</i> not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou he <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink <i class="calibre6">of it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, <i class="calibre6">and</i> despised among men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour <i class="calibre6">cities</i> thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a chosen <i class="calibre6">man, that</i> I may appoint over her? for who <i class="calibre6">is</i> like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Damascus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; <i class="calibre6">there is</i> sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Damascus is waxed feeble, <i class="calibre6">and</i> turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on <i class="calibre6">her</i>: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Kedar and Hazor</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear <i class="calibre6">is</i> on every side.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, <i class="calibre6">which</i> dwell alone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them <i class="calibre6">that are</i> in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor <i class="calibre6">any</i> son of man dwell in it.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Elam</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>But it shall come to pass in the latter days, <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
