<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Reuben, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou <i class="calibre6">it</i>: he went up to my couch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Simeon and Levi <i class="calibre6">are</i> brethren; instruments of cruelty <i class="calibre6">are in</i> their habitations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Cursed <i class="calibre6">be</i> their anger, for <i class="calibre6">it was</i> fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Judah, thou <i class="calibre6">art he</i> whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Judah <i class="calibre6">is</i> a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him <i class="calibre6">shall</i> the gathering of the people <i class="calibre6">be</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>His eyes <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> for an haven of ships; and his border <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> unto Zidon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Issachar <i class="calibre6">is</i> a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he saw that rest <i class="calibre6">was</i> good, and the land that <i class="calibre6">it was</i> pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Out of Asher his bread <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Naphtali <i class="calibre6">is</i> a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Joseph <i class="calibre6">is</i> a fruitful bough, <i class="calibre6">even</i> a fruitful bough by a well; <i class="calibre6">whose</i> branches run over the wall:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot <i class="calibre6">at him</i>, and hated him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty <i class="calibre6">God</i> of Jacob; (from thence <i class="calibre6">is</i> the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span><i class="calibre6">Even</i> by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Benjamin shall ravin <i class="calibre6">as</i> a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>All these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the twelve tribes of Israel: and this <i class="calibre6">is it</i> that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Death of Jacob</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>In the cave that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the field of Machpelah, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>The purchase of the field and of the cave that <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein <i class="calibre6">was</i> from the children of Heth. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</p></div></body></html>
