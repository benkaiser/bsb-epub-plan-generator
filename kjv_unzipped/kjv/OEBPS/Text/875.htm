<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, <i class="calibre6">and</i> idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff <i class="calibre6">that</i> is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Anger</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Yet I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no saviour beside me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe <i class="calibre6">them</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I will meet them as a bear <i class="calibre6">that is</i> bereaved <i class="calibre6">of her whelps</i>, and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Mercy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me <i class="calibre6">is</i> thine help.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I will be thy king: where <i class="calibre6">is any other</i> that may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took <i class="calibre6">him</i> away in my wrath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The iniquity of Ephraim <i class="calibre6">is</i> bound up; his sin <i class="calibre6">is</i> hid.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he <i class="calibre6">is</i> an unwise son; for he should not stay long in <i class="calibre6">the place of</i> the breaking forth of children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Judgment on Samaria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Though he be fruitful among <i class="calibre6">his</i> brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</p></div></body></html>
