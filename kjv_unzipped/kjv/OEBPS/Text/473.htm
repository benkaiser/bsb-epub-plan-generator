  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Elihu Proclaims God's Majesty</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound <i class="calibre6">that</i> goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For he saith to the snow, Be thou <i class="calibre6">on</i> the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>How thy garments <i class="calibre6">are</i> warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south <i class="calibre6">wind</i>?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Hast thou with him spread out the sky, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> strong, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as a molten looking glass?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Teach us what we shall say unto him; <i class="calibre6">for</i> we cannot order <i class="calibre6">our speech</i> by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And now <i class="calibre6">men</i> see not the bright light which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God <i class="calibre6">is</i> terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span><i class="calibre6">Touching</i> the Almighty, we cannot find him out: <i class="calibre6">he is</i> excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any <i class="calibre6">that are</i> wise of heart.</p></div></body></html>
