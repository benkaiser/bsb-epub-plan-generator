  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul and Timothy<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Thessalonians 1:1-10; 2 Thessalonians 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy <i class="calibre6">our</i> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And to <i class="calibre6">our</i> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philemon's Faith and Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Appeal for Onesimus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech <i class="calibre6">thee</i>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <i class="calibre6">thee</i> ought, put that on mine account; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>I Paul have written <i class="calibre6">it</i> with mine own hand, I will repay <i class="calibre6">it</i>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Additional Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with your spirit. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
