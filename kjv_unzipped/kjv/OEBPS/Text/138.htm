  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Victory over the Canaanites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And <i class="calibre6">when</i> king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took <i class="calibre6">some</i> of them prisoners. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Bronze Serpent</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no bread, neither <i class="calibre6">is there any</i> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Journey to Moab</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Moab, toward the sunrising. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon <i class="calibre6">is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And from thence <i class="calibre6">they went</i> to Beer: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by <i class="calibre6">the direction of</i> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness <i class="calibre6">they went</i> to Mattanah:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And from Bamoth <i class="calibre6">in</i> the valley, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Defeat of Sihon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <i class="calibre6">of</i> the waters of the well: <i class="calibre6">but</i> we will go along by the king's <i class="calibre6">high</i> way, until we be past thy borders. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <i class="calibre6">was</i> strong. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>For Heshbon <i class="calibre6">was</i> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which <i class="calibre6">reacheth</i> unto Medeba.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Defeat of Og</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <i class="calibre6">were</i> there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p></div></body></html>
