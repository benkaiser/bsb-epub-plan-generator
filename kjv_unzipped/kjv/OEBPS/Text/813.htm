  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Evil in High Places</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD'S house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Then said he unto me, Son of man, these <i class="calibre6">are</i> the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Which say, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> not near; let us build houses: this <i class="calibre6">city is</i> the caldron, and we <i class="calibre6">be</i> the flesh. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak; Thus saith the LORD; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: for I know the things that come into your mind, <i class="calibre6">every one of</i> them. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the flesh, and this <i class="calibre6">city is</i> the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>This <i class="calibre6">city</i> shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; <i class="calibre6">but</i> I will judge you in the border of Israel: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that <i class="calibre6">are</i> round about you.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Promise of Restoration</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Son of man, thy brethren, <i class="calibre6">even</i> thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, <i class="calibre6">are</i> they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But <i class="calibre6">as for them</i> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Glory Leaves Jerusalem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel <i class="calibre6">was</i> over them above. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the east side of the city. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</p></div></body></html>
