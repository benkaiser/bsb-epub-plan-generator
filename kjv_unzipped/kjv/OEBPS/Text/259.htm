<span class="reftext">2</span>Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, <i class="calibre6">that</i> he came down <i class="calibre6">with</i> an ephod in his hand.</p>
<p class="hdg">Saul Pursues David</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver <i class="calibre6">thee</i> up. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then David and his men, <i class="calibre6">which were</i> about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David <i class="calibre6">was</i> in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the south of Jeshimon? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> to deliver him into the king's hand. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Saul said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, <i class="calibre6">and</i> who hath seen him there: for it is told me <i class="calibre6">that</i> he dealeth very subtilly. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Saul also and his men went to seek <i class="calibre6">him</i>. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard <i class="calibre6">that</i>, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.</p></div></body></html>
