<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, <i class="calibre6">and</i> them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>
<p class="hdg">A New Song of Praise<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 98:1-9; Psalm 149:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Sing unto the LORD a new song, <i class="calibre6">and</i> his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up <i class="calibre6">their voice</i>, the villages <i class="calibre6">that</i> Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, <i class="calibre6">and</i> refrained myself: <i class="calibre6">now</i> will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And I will bring the blind by a way <i class="calibre6">that</i> they knew not; I will lead them in paths <i class="calibre6">that</i> they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> our gods.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel is Deaf and Blind</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger <i class="calibre6">that</i> I sent? who <i class="calibre6">is</i> blind as <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make <i class="calibre6">it</i> honourable.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>But this <i class="calibre6">is</i> a people robbed and spoiled; <i class="calibre6">they are</i> all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Who among you will give ear to this? <i class="calibre6">who</i> will hearken and hear for the time to come?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> not to heart.</p></div></body></html>
