In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Asa did <i class="calibre6">that which was</i> good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For he took away the altars of the strange <i class="calibre6">gods</i>, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about <i class="calibre6">them</i> walls, and towers, gates, and bars, <i class="calibre6">while</i> the land <i class="calibre6">is</i> yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Asa had an army <i class="calibre6">of men</i> that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these <i class="calibre6">were</i> mighty men of valour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> our God; let not man prevail against thee. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Asa and the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p></div></body></html>
