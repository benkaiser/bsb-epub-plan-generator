O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending <i class="calibre6">it</i> in pieces, while <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none to deliver.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take <i class="calibre6">it</i>; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me <i class="calibre6">to</i> the judgment <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou hast commanded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity <i class="calibre6">that is</i> in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>My defence <i class="calibre6">is</i> of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry <i class="calibre6">with the wicked</i> every day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch <i class="calibre6">which</i> he made.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</p></div></body></html>
