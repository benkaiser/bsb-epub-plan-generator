  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Nathan Rebukes David<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 51:1-19)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The rich <i class="calibre6">man</i> had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>But the poor <i class="calibre6">man</i> had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i class="calibre6">As</i> the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <i class="calibre6">thing</i> shall surely die: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Nathan said to David, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i class="calibre6">that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i class="calibre6">to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For thou didst <i class="calibre6">it</i> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Loss and Repentance</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also <i class="calibre6">that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the elders of his house arose, <i class="calibre6">and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed <i class="calibre6">himself</i>, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i class="calibre6">is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i class="calibre6">while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell <i class="calibre6">whether</i> GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Solomon's Birth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">David Captures Rabbah<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Chronicles 20:1-3)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof <i class="calibre6">was</i> a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was <i class="calibre6">set</i> on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he brought forth the people that <i class="calibre6">were</i> therein, and put <i class="calibre6">them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p></div></body></html>
