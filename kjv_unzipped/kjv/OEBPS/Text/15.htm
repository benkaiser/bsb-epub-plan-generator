<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house <i class="calibre6">is</i> this Eliezer of Damascus? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And, behold, the word of the LORD <i class="calibre6">came</i> unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he said unto him, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>
<p class="hdg">God Confirms His Promise<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Numbers 34:1-15; Romans 4:13-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land <i class="calibre6">that is</i> not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites <i class="calibre6">is</i> not yet full.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</p></div></body></html>
