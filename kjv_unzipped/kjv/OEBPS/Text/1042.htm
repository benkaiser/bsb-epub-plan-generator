<span class="reftext">2</span>And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse <i class="calibre6">him</i>, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>We accept <i class="calibre6">it</i> always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For we have found this man <i class="calibre6">a</i> pestilent <i class="calibre6">fellow</i>, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But the chief captain Lysias came <i class="calibre6">upon us</i>, and with great violence took <i class="calibre6">him</i> away out of our hands, 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Defends His Testimony</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and <i class="calibre6">toward</i> men. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Or else let these same <i class="calibre6">here</i> say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">Felix Holds Paul in Custody</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of <i class="calibre6">that</i> way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let <i class="calibre6">him</i> have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p></div></body></html>
