<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover <i class="calibre6">their</i> nakedness: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy father's nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, <i class="calibre6">whether she be</i> born at home, or born abroad, <i class="calibre6">even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, <i class="calibre6">even</i> their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs <i class="calibre6">is</i> thine own nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy father's near kinswoman. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy mother's near kinswoman. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thine aunt. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy brother's nakedness. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; <i class="calibre6">for</i> they <i class="calibre6">are</i> her near kinswomen: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> wickedness. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex <i class="calibre6">her</i>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life <i class="calibre6">time</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through <i class="calibre6">the fire</i> to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> abomination. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> confusion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit <i class="calibre6">any</i> of these abominations; <i class="calibre6">neither</i> any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which <i class="calibre6">were</i> before you, and the land is defiled;) 
<span class="reftext">28</span>That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that <i class="calibre6">were</i> before you. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit <i class="calibre6">them</i> shall be cut off from among their people. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that <i class="calibre6">ye</i> commit not <i class="calibre6">any one</i> of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God.</p></div></body></html>
