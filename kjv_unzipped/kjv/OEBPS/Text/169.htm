<span class="reftext">2</span>Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there <i class="calibre6">any thing</i> of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And thou shalt roast and eat <i class="calibre6">it</i> in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work <i class="calibre6">therein</i>.</p>

<span class="reftext">10</span>And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give <i class="calibre6">unto the LORD thy God</i>, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that <i class="calibre6">is</i> within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that <i class="calibre6">are</i> among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.

<span class="reftext">15</span>Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Every man <i class="calibre6">shall give</i> as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.</p>
