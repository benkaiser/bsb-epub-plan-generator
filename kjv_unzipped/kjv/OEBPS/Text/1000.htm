  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus and Nicodemus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i class="calibre6">of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you <i class="calibre6">of</i> heavenly things? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
<p class="hdg">For God So Loved<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 22:1-10; Romans 5:6-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
<p class="hdg">John's Testimony Concerning Jesus</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then there arose a question between <i class="calibre6">some</i> of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all <i class="calibre6">men</i> come to him. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>He must increase, but I <i class="calibre6">must</i> decrease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p></div></body></html>
