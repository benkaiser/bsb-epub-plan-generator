<span class="reftext">2</span>Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And those men said unto him, We <i class="calibre6">are</i> defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or <i class="calibre6">be</i> in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, <i class="calibre6">and</i> eat it with unleavened bread and bitter <i class="calibre6">herbs</i>. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But the man that <i class="calibre6">is</i> clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Cloud above the Tabernacle<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Exodus 40:34-38)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>So it was alway: the cloud covered it <i class="calibre6">by day</i>, and the appearance of fire by night. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And <i class="calibre6">so</i> it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And <i class="calibre6">so</i> it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether <i class="calibre6">it was</i> by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Or <i class="calibre6">whether it were</i> two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p></div></body></html>
