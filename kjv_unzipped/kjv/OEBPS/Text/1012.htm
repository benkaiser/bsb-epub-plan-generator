  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus the True Vine</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every <i class="calibre6">branch</i> that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>I am the vine, ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast <i class="calibre6">them</i> into the fire, and they are burned. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> your joy might be full.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Greater Love has No One than This</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Hatred of the World</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <i class="calibre6">it hated</i> you. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>He that hateth me hateth my Father also. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But <i class="calibre6">this cometh to pass</i>, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</p></div></body></html>
