<span class="reftext">2</span>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i> gracious.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Living Stone<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 28:14-22; 1 Corinthians 3:10-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>To whom coming, <i class="calibre6">as unto</i> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <i class="calibre6">and</i> precious, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Unto you therefore which believe <i class="calibre6">he is</i> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <i class="calibre6">even to them</i> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Which in time past <i class="calibre6">were</i> not a people, but <i class="calibre6">are</i> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Dearly beloved, I beseech <i class="calibre6">you</i> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by <i class="calibre6">your</i> good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p class="hdg">Submission to Authorities<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 13:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>As free, and not using <i class="calibre6">your</i> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Honour all <i class="calibre6">men</i>. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Servants, <i class="calibre6">be</i> subject to <i class="calibre6">your</i> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For what glory <i class="calibre6">is it</i>, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <i class="calibre6">for it</i>, ye take it patiently, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> acceptable with God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ's Example of Suffering<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 53:1-8; Matthew 26:57-68; Mark 14:53-65; John 18:19-24)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <i class="calibre6">himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</p></div></body></html>
