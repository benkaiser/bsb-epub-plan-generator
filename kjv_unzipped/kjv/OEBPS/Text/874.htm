<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him <i class="calibre6">in</i> Bethel, and there he spake with us;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> his memorial.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">He is</i> a merchant, the balances of deceit <i class="calibre6">are</i> in his hand: he loveth to oppress.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: <i class="calibre6">in</i> all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that <i class="calibre6">were</i> sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I <i class="calibre6">that am</i> the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">Is there</i> iniquity <i class="calibre6">in</i> Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars <i class="calibre6">are</i> as heaps in the furrows of the fields.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept <i class="calibre6">sheep</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Ephraim provoked <i class="calibre6">him</i> to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</p></div></body></html>
