<span class="reftext">2</span>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Purpose of Jesus' Parables<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 13:10-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all <i class="calibre6">these</i> things are done in parables: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> sins should be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Sower Explained<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 13:18-23)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>The sower soweth the word. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lesson of the Lamp<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 8:16-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Seed Growing Secretly</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Mustard Seed<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 13:31-32; Luke 13:18-19)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? 
<span class="reftext">31</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Stills the Storm<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 8:23-27; Luke 8:22-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p></div></body></html>
