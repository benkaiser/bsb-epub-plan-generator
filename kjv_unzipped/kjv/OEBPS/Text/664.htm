  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Approaching God with Awe</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter <i class="calibre6">any</i> thing before God: for God <i class="calibre6">is</i> in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice <i class="calibre6">is known</i> by multitude of words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <i class="calibre6">he hath</i> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Better <i class="calibre6">is it</i> that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <i class="calibre6">was</i> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For in the multitude of dreams and many words <i class="calibre6">there are</i> also <i class="calibre6">divers</i> vanities: but fear thou God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Wealth is Meaningless</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> higher than the highest regardeth; and <i class="calibre6">there be</i> higher than they. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <i class="calibre6">himself</i> is served by the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <i class="calibre6">is</i> also vanity. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <i class="calibre6">is there</i> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <i class="calibre6">of them</i> with their eyes? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The sleep of a labouring man <i class="calibre6">is</i> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>There is a sore evil <i class="calibre6">which</i> I have seen under the sun, <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> nothing in his hand. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> a sore evil, <i class="calibre6">that</i> in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and <i class="calibre6">he hath</i> much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Behold <i class="calibre6">that</i> which I have seen: <i class="calibre6">it is</i> good and comely <i class="calibre6">for one</i> to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> his portion. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the gift of God. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth <i class="calibre6">him</i> in the joy of his heart.</p></div></body></html>
