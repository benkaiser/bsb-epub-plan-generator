  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">No One is Just</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be <i class="calibre6">any</i> that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>O LORD, <i class="calibre6">are</i> not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, <i class="calibre6">but</i> they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore I said, Surely these <i class="calibre6">are</i> poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, <i class="calibre6">nor</i> the judgment of their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, <i class="calibre6">and</i> burst the bonds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, <i class="calibre6">and</i> their backslidings are increased.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>They were <i class="calibre6">as</i> fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Shall I not visit for these <i class="calibre6">things</i>? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> not the LORD'S.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They have belied the LORD, and said, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And the prophets shall become wind, and the word <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in them: thus shall it be done unto them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Judgment Proclaimed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a mighty nation, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Their quiver <i class="calibre6">is</i> as an open sepulchre, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> all mighty men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, <i class="calibre6">which</i> thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these <i class="calibre6">things</i> unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land <i class="calibre6">that is</i> not yours.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand <i class="calibre6">for</i> the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Your iniquities have turned away these <i class="calibre6">things</i>, and your sins have withholden good <i class="calibre6">things</i> from you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For among my people are found wicked <i class="calibre6">men</i>: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>As a cage is full of birds, so <i class="calibre6">are</i> their houses full of deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Shall I not visit for these <i class="calibre6">things</i>? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love <i class="calibre6">to have it</i> so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?</p></div></body></html>
