<span class="reftext">2</span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Jordan. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that <i class="calibre6">is</i> before Jordan. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Widow of Zarephath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which <i class="calibre6">belongeth</i> to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman <i class="calibre6">was</i> there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And as she was going to fetch <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And she said, <i class="calibre6">As</i> the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go <i class="calibre6">and</i> do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day <i class="calibre6">that</i> the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat <i class="calibre6">many</i> days. 
<span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.</p>
<p class="hdg">Elijah Raises the Widow's Son</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And it came to pass after these things, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a man of God, <i class="calibre6">and</i> that the word of the LORD in thy mouth <i class="calibre6">is</i> truth.</p></div></body></html>
