<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram <i class="calibre6">was</i> seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite <i class="calibre6">was</i> then in the land. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, <i class="calibre6">having</i> Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>
<p class="hdg">Abram and Sarai in Egypt</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine <i class="calibre6">was</i> grievous in the land. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a fair woman to look upon: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Say, I pray thee, thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she <i class="calibre6">was</i> very fair. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> this <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy wife? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Why saidst thou, She <i class="calibre6">is</i> my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take <i class="calibre6">her</i>, and go thy way. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Pharaoh commanded <i class="calibre6">his</i> men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p></div></body></html>
