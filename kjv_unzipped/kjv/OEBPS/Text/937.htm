<span class="reftext">3</span>And Jesus put forth <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

<span class="reftext">10</span>When Jesus heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, <i class="calibre6">so</i> be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</p>

<span class="reftext">26</span>And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>
