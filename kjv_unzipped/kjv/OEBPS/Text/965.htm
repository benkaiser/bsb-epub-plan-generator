<span class="reftext">2</span>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these <i class="calibre6">men</i> with bread here in the wilderness? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before <i class="calibre6">them</i>; and they did set <i class="calibre6">them</i> before the people. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken <i class="calibre6">meat</i> that was left seven baskets. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pharisees Seek a Sign<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 16:1-4; Luke 12:54-56)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.</p>
<p class="hdg">Leaven of the Pharisees and Herod<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 16:5-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now <i class="calibre6">the disciples</i> had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> the leaven of Herod. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> because we have no bread. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And when Jesus knew <i class="calibre6">it</i>, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>
<p class="hdg">A Blind Man Healed at Bethsaida</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>After that he put <i class="calibre6">his</i> hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell <i class="calibre6">it</i> to any in the town.</p>
<p class="hdg">Peter's Confession of Christ<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 16:13-20; Luke 9:18-20; John 6:66-71)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some <i class="calibre6">say</i>, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Predicts His Death and Resurrection<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 16:21-23; Luke 9:21-22)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>
<p class="hdg">Take up Your Cross<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 10:37-39; Matthew 16:24-28; Luke 9:23-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>And when he had called the people <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? 
<span class="reftext">37</span>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
<span class="reftext">38</span>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</p></div></body></html>
