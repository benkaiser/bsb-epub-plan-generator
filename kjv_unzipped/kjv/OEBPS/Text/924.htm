<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But he shall say, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> no prophet, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And <i class="calibre6">one</i> shall say unto him, What <i class="calibre6">are</i> these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, <i class="calibre6">Those</i> with which I was wounded <i class="calibre6">in</i> the house of my friends.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Shepherd Struck, Sheep Scattered</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <i class="calibre6">that is</i> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> in all the land, saith the LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off <i class="calibre6">and</i> die; but the third shall be left therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It <i class="calibre6">is</i> my people: and they shall say, The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> my God.</p></div></body></html>
