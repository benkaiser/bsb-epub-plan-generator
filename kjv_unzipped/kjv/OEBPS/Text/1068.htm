  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Settle Lawsuits among Believers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <i class="calibre6">suffer yourselves to</i> be defrauded? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <i class="calibre6">your</i> brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Our Bodies are Members of Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <i class="calibre6">is</i> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <i class="calibre6">them</i> the members of an harlot? God forbid. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Body is a Temple of the Holy Spirit<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 12:1-8; 1 Corinthians 3:16-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i class="calibre6">which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</p></div></body></html>
