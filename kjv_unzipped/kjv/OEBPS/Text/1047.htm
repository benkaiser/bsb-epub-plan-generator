  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings to the Saints in Rome</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <i class="calibre6">to be</i> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,) 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And declared <i class="calibre6">to be</i> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <i class="calibre6">to be</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Desire to Visit Rome<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Thessalonians 2:17-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
<p class="hdg">I am Not Ashamed of the Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Wrath against Sin<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Jeremiah 6:10-21; Jeremiah 25:15-33; Jonah 1:4-10; Acts 27:13-26)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto them. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i class="calibre6">even</i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i class="calibre6">him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And even as they did not like to retain God in <i class="calibre6">their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p></div></body></html>
