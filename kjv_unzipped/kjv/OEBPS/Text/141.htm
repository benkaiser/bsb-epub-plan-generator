<span class="reftext">2</span>And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding <i class="calibre6">in his tents</i> according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling <i class="calibre6">into a trance</i>, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, <i class="calibre6">and</i> thy tabernacles, O Israel!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as cedar trees beside the waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce <i class="calibre6">them</i> through with his arrows.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that blesseth thee, and cursed <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that curseth thee.</p>
<p class="hdg">Balak Dismisses Balaam</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed <i class="calibre6">them</i> these three times. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do <i class="calibre6">either</i> good or bad of mine own mind; <i class="calibre6">but</i> what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And now, behold, I go unto my people: come <i class="calibre6">therefore, and</i> I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</p>
<p class="hdg">Balaam's Fourth Oracle</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, <i class="calibre6">which</i> saw the vision of the Almighty, falling <i class="calibre6">into a trance</i>, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.</p>
<p class="hdg">Balaam's Final Three Oracles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek <i class="calibre6">was</i> the first of the nations; but his latter end <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> that he perish for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And ships <i class="calibre6">shall come</i> from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.</p></div></body></html>
