  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Dead to Sin, Alive to God<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Corinthians 4:7-18)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <i class="calibre6">in the likeness</i> of <i class="calibre6">his</i> resurrection: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <i class="calibre6">him</i>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Neither yield ye your members <i class="calibre6">as</i> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <i class="calibre6">as</i> instruments of righteousness unto God. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Wages of Sin<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Peter 3:14-22)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <i class="calibre6">is</i> death. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For the wages of sin <i class="calibre6">is</i> death; but the gift of God <i class="calibre6">is</i> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p></div></body></html>
