<span class="reftext">2</span>And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, <i class="calibre6">and</i> brought gifts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <i class="calibre6">horses</i>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then David put <i class="calibre6">garrisons</i> in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, <i class="calibre6">and</i> brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i class="calibre6">with him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i class="calibre6">these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<span class="reftext">16</span>And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i class="calibre6">were</i> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i class="calibre6">was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <i class="calibre6">were</i> chief about the king.</p></div></body></html>
