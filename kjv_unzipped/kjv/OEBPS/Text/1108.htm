<span class="reftext">4</span>Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love <i class="calibre6">which ye have</i> to all the saints, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For this cause we also, since the day we heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

<span class="reftext">17</span>And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <i class="calibre6">things</i> he might have the preeminence. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For it pleased <i class="calibre6">the Father</i> that in him should all fulness dwell; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, <i class="calibre6">I say</i>, whether <i class="calibre6">they be</i> things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <i class="calibre6">your</i> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

<span class="reftext">23</span>If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and <i class="calibre6">be</i> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, <i class="calibre6">and</i> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</p>
