  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job's Final Appeal</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For what portion of God <i class="calibre6">is there</i> from above? and <i class="calibre6">what</i> inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not destruction to the wicked? and a strange <i class="calibre6">punishment</i> to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span><i class="calibre6">Then</i> let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or <i class="calibre6">if</i> I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">Then</i> let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> an heinous crime; yea, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> an iniquity <i class="calibre6">to be punished by</i> the judges.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a fire <i class="calibre6">that</i> consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>If I have withheld the poor from <i class="calibre6">their</i> desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as <i class="calibre6">with</i> a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>If his loins have not blessed me, and <i class="calibre6">if</i> he were <i class="calibre6">not</i> warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span><i class="calibre6">Then</i> let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>For destruction <i class="calibre6">from</i> God <i class="calibre6">was</i> a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, <i class="calibre6">Thou art</i> my confidence;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>If I rejoiced because my wealth <i class="calibre6">was</i> great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking <i class="calibre6">in</i> brightness;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>This also <i class="calibre6">were</i> an iniquity <i class="calibre6">to be punished by</i> the judge: for I should have denied the God <i class="calibre6">that is</i> above.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>The stranger did not lodge in the street: <i class="calibre6">but</i> I opened my doors to the traveller.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, <i class="calibre6">and</i> went not out of the door?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire <i class="calibre6">is, that</i> the Almighty would answer me, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> mine adversary had written a book.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, <i class="calibre6">and</i> bind it <i class="calibre6">as</i> a crown to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p></div></body></html>
