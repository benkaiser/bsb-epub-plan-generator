<span class="reftext">2</span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Some said, This is he: others <i class="calibre6">said</i>, He is like him: <i class="calibre6">but</i> he said, I am <i class="calibre6">he</i>. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pharisees Investigate</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>These <i class="calibre6">words</i> spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner <i class="calibre6">or no</i>, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear <i class="calibre6">it</i> again? will ye also be his disciples? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>We know that God spake unto Moses: <i class="calibre6">as for</i> this <i class="calibre6">fellow</i>, we know not from whence he is. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and <i class="calibre6">yet</i> he hath opened mine eyes. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="hdg">Spiritual Sight and Blindness</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 
<span class="reftext">36</span>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
<span class="reftext">41</span>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p></div></body></html>
