<span class="reftext">7</span>Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; <i class="calibre6">as</i> the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; <i class="calibre6">therefore</i> they <i class="calibre6">are</i> unclean unto you.
