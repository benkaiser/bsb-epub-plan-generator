<span class="reftext">2</span>And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver <i class="calibre6">is</i> with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed <i class="calibre6">be thou</i> of the LORD, my son. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when he had restored the eleven hundred <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>In those days <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no king in Israel, <i class="calibre6">but</i> every man did <i class="calibre6">that which was</i> right in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who <i class="calibre6">was</i> a Levite, and he sojourned there. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find <i class="calibre6">a place</i>: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find <i class="calibre6">a place</i>. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten <i class="calibre6">shekels</i> of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to <i class="calibre6">my</i> priest.</p></div></body></html>
