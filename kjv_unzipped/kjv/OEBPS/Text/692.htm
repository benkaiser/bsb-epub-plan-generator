  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Judgment against Babylon</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, <i class="calibre6">even</i> them that rejoice in my highness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Howl ye; for the day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces <i class="calibre6">shall be as</i> flames.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And I will punish the world for <i class="calibre6">their</i> evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined <i class="calibre6">unto them</i> shall fall by the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and <i class="calibre6">as for</i> gold, they shall not delight in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span><i class="calibre6">Their</i> bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in <i class="calibre6">their</i> pleasant palaces: and her time <i class="calibre6">is</i> near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</p></div></body></html>
