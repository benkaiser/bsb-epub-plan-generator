<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no shepherd.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And they shall be as mighty <i class="calibre6">men</i>, which tread down <i class="calibre6">their enemies</i> in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight, because the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD their God, and will hear them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And <i class="calibre6">they of</i> Ephraim shall be like a mighty <i class="calibre6">man</i>, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase as they have increased.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and <i class="calibre6">place</i> shall not be found for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
