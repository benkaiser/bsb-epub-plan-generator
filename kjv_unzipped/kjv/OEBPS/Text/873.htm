<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">As</i> they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour <i class="calibre6">them</i>, because of their own counsels.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt <i class="calibre6">him</i>.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</p></div></body></html>
