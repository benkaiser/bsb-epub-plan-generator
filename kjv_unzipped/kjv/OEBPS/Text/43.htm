  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Return to Egypt with Benjamin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the famine <i class="calibre6">was</i> sore in the land. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But if thou wilt not send <i class="calibre6">him</i>, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye <i class="calibre6">so</i> ill with me, <i class="calibre6">as</i> to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, <i class="calibre6">Is</i> your father yet alive? have ye <i class="calibre6">another</i> brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, <i class="calibre6">and</i> also our little ones. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And their father Israel said unto them, If <i class="calibre6">it must be</i> so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry <i class="calibre6">it</i> again in your hand; peradventure it <i class="calibre6">was</i> an oversight: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved <i class="calibre6">of my children</i>, I am bereaved. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph's Hospitality to his Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring <i class="calibre6">these</i> men home, and slay, and make ready; for <i class="calibre6">these</i> men shall dine with me at noon. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, <i class="calibre6">every</i> man's money <i class="calibre6">was</i> in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he said, Peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave <i class="calibre6">them</i> water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which <i class="calibre6">was</i> in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he asked them of <i class="calibre6">their</i> welfare, and said, <i class="calibre6">Is</i> your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? <i class="calibre6">Is</i> he yet alive? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And they answered, Thy servant our father <i class="calibre6">is</i> in good health, he <i class="calibre6">is</i> yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, <i class="calibre6">Is</i> this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought <i class="calibre6">where</i> to weep; and he entered into <i class="calibre6">his</i> chamber, and wept there. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that <i class="calibre6">is</i> an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And he took <i class="calibre6">and sent</i> messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p></div></body></html>
