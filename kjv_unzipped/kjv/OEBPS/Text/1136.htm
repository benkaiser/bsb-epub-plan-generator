  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Our Apostle and High Priest</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses <i class="calibre6">was faithful</i> in all his house. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For this <i class="calibre6">man</i> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For every house is builded by some <i class="calibre6">man</i>; but he that built all things <i class="calibre6">is</i> God. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Moses verily <i class="calibre6">was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>
<p class="hdg">Do Not Harden Your Hearts</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in <i class="calibre6">their</i> heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
<p class="hdg">The Dangers of Unbelief</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? <i class="calibre6">was it</i> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p></div></body></html>
