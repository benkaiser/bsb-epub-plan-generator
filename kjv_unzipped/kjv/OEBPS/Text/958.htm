<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Baptism of Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 3:13-17; Luke 3:21-22; John 1:29-34)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And there came a voice from heaven, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Temptation of Jesus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 4:1-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Preaches in Galilee<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 9:1-7; Matthew 4:12-17; Luke 4:14-15)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Calls His First Disciples<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 4:18-22; Matthew 13:47-52; Luke 5:1-11; John 1:35-42)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the <i class="calibre6">son</i> of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Expels an Evil Spirit<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 4:31-37)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Saying, Let <i class="calibre6">us</i> alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine <i class="calibre6">is</i> this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals at Peter's House<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And all the city was gathered together at the door. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Prays and Preaches<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 4:42-44)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All <i class="calibre6">men</i> seek for thee. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Leper's Prayer<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 14:1-32; Matthew 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth <i class="calibre6">his</i> hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>But he went out, and began to publish <i class="calibre6">it</i> much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p></div></body></html>
