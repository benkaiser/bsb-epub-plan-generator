<span class="reftext">2</span>But for his kin, that is near unto him, <i class="calibre6">that is</i>, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. 
<span class="reftext">4</span><i class="calibre6">But</i> he shall not defile himself, <i class="calibre6">being</i> a chief man among his people, to profane himself. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>They shall not take a wife <i class="calibre6">that is</i> a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy unto his God. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, <i class="calibre6">am</i> holy. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And <i class="calibre6">he that is</i> the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon him: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, <i class="calibre6">or</i> an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever <i class="calibre6">he be</i> of thy seed in their generations that hath <i class="calibre6">any</i> blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.</p>

<span class="reftext">19</span>Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>He shall eat the bread of his God, <i class="calibre6">both</i> of the most holy, and of the holy. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Moses told <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.</p></div></body></html>
