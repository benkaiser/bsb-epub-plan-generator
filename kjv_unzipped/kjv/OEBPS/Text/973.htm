<span class="reftext">2</span>And very early in the morning the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to any <i class="calibre6">man</i>; for they were afraid.</p>

<span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.</p>
