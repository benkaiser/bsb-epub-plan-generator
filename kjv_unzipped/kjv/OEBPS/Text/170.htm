<p class="hdg">Purge the Idolater</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And it be told thee, and thou hast heard <i class="calibre6">of it</i>, and inquired diligently, and, behold, <i class="calibre6">it be</i> true, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the thing certain, <i class="calibre6">that</i> such abomination is wrought in Israel: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, <i class="calibre6">even</i> that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; <i class="calibre6">but</i> at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.

<span class="reftext">9</span>And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, <i class="calibre6">to</i> the right hand, nor <i class="calibre6">to</i> the left. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
