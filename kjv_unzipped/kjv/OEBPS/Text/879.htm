  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord Judges the Nations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and <i class="calibre6">for</i> my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly <i class="calibre6">and</i> speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> strong.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness <i class="calibre6">is</i> great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> near in the valley of decision.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD <i class="calibre6">will be</i> the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Blessings for God's People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>So shall ye know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence <i class="calibre6">against</i> the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For I will cleanse their blood <i class="calibre6">that</i> I have not cleansed: for the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</p></div></body></html>
