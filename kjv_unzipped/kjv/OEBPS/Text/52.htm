<span class="reftext">2</span>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he <i class="calibre6">was a</i> goodly <i class="calibre6">child</i>, she hid him three months. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> in the flags by the river's brink. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Pharaoh's Daughter Rescues Moses</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash <i class="calibre6">herself</i> at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when she had opened <i class="calibre6">it</i>, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This <i class="calibre6">is one</i> of the Hebrews' children. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give <i class="calibre6">thee</i> thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moses Kills an Egyptian</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moses Flees to Midian</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew <i class="calibre6">water</i>, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How <i class="calibre6">is it that</i> ye are come so soon to day? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew <i class="calibre6">water</i> enough for us, and watered the flock. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he said unto his daughters, And where <i class="calibre6">is</i> he? why <i class="calibre6">is</i> it <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And she bare <i class="calibre6">him</i> a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p class="hdg">God Hears the Israelites' Cry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p></div></body></html>
