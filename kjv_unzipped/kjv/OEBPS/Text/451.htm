<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou the first man <i class="calibre6">that</i> was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>What knowest thou, that we know not? <i class="calibre6">what</i> understandest thou, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in us?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>With us <i class="calibre6">are</i> both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">Are</i> the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest <i class="calibre6">such</i> words go out of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>What <i class="calibre6">is</i> man, that he should be clean? and <i class="calibre6">he which is</i> born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>How much more abominable and filthy <i class="calibre6">is</i> man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I will shew thee, hear me; and that <i class="calibre6">which</i> I have seen I will declare;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid <i class="calibre6">it</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The wicked man travaileth with pain all <i class="calibre6">his</i> days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>A dreadful sound <i class="calibre6">is</i> in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>He wandereth abroad for bread, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>, Where <i class="calibre6">is it</i>? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>He runneth upon him, <i class="calibre6">even</i> on <i class="calibre6">his</i> neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on <i class="calibre6">his</i> flanks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And he dwelleth in desolate cities, <i class="calibre6">and</i> in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>For the congregation of hypocrites <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p></div></body></html>
