A <i class="calibre6">certain</i> man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and digged <i class="calibre6">a place for</i> the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they caught <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and beat him, and sent <i class="calibre6">him</i> away empty. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded <i class="calibre6">him</i> in the head, and sent <i class="calibre6">him</i> away shamefully handled. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And they took him, and killed <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and cast <i class="calibre6">him</i> out of the vineyard. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paying Taxes to Caesar<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 22:15-22; Luke 20:19-26)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in <i class="calibre6">his</i> words. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And they brought <i class="calibre6">it</i>. And he saith unto them, Whose <i class="calibre6">is</i> this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sadducees Question the Resurrection<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 22:23-33; Luke 20:27-40)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave <i class="calibre6">his</i> wife <i class="calibre6">behind him</i>, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Greatest Commandment<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 6:1-19; Matthew 22:34-40)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all? 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments <i class="calibre6">is</i>, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord: 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the first commandment. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And the second <i class="calibre6">is</i> like, <i class="calibre6">namely</i> this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love <i class="calibre6">his</i> neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him <i class="calibre6">any question</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Whose Son is the Christ?<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 22:41-46; Luke 20:41-44)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he <i class="calibre6">then</i> his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="hdg">Beware of the Scribes<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 20:45-47)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and <i class="calibre6">love</i> salutations in the marketplaces, 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts: 
<span class="reftext">40</span>Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Poor Widow's Offering<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Luke 21:1-4)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And he called <i class="calibre6">unto him</i> his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: 
<span class="reftext">44</span>For all <i class="calibre6">they</i> did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all her living.</p></div></body></html>
