  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Bildad: God Punishes the Wicked</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>How long <i class="calibre6">will it be ere</i> ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Wherefore are we counted as beasts, <i class="calibre6">and</i> reputed vile in your sight?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The gin shall take <i class="calibre6">him</i> by the heel, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the robber shall prevail against him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The snare <i class="calibre6">is</i> laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> ready at his side.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>It shall devour the strength of his skin: <i class="calibre6">even</i> the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because <i class="calibre6">it is</i> none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>They that come after <i class="calibre6">him</i> shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Surely such <i class="calibre6">are</i> the dwellings of the wicked, and this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the place <i class="calibre6">of him that</i> knoweth not God.</p></div></body></html>
