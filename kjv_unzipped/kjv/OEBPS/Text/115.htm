<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: <i class="calibre6">for</i> it is a year of rest unto the land. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,

<span class="reftext">9</span>Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout <i class="calibre6">all</i> the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather <i class="calibre6">the grapes</i> in it of thy vine undressed. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.</p>
<p class="hdg">Return of Property</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest <i class="calibre6">ought</i> of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, <i class="calibre6">and</i> according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

<span class="reftext">17</span>Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God.</p>

<span class="reftext">20</span>And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

<p class="hdg">The Law of Redemption</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine; for ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> strangers and sojourners with me.

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away <i class="calibre6">some</i> of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

<span class="reftext">27</span>Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>But if he be not able to restore <i class="calibre6">it</i> to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; <i class="calibre6">within</i> a full year may he redeem it. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in <i class="calibre6">the year of</i> jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites <i class="calibre6">are</i> their possession among the children of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it <i class="calibre6">is</i> their perpetual possession.</p>
<p class="hdg">Redemption of the Poor</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: <i class="calibre6">yea, though he be</i> a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to be your God.</p>

<span class="reftext">42</span>For they <i class="calibre6">are</i> my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that <i class="calibre6">are</i> with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit <i class="calibre6">them for</i> a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.</p>
<p class="hdg">Redemption of Servants</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother <i class="calibre6">that dwelleth</i> by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger <i class="calibre6">or</i> sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 
<span class="reftext">48</span>After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: 
<span class="reftext">49</span>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or <i class="calibre6">any</i> that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him. 
<span class="reftext">51</span>If <i class="calibre6">there be</i> yet many years <i class="calibre6">behind</i>, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, <i class="calibre6">and</i> according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. 
<span class="reftext">53</span><i class="calibre6">And</i> as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: <i class="calibre6">and the other</i> shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

<span class="reftext">55</span>For unto me the children of Israel <i class="calibre6">are</i> servants; they <i class="calibre6">are</i> my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD your God.</p></div></body></html>
