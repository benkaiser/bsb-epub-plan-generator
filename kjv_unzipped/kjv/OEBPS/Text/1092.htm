  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Greeting to the Galatians<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Ephesians 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> to you and peace from God the Father, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>To whom <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">No Other Gospel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>As we said before, so say I now again, If any <i class="calibre6">man</i> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Defends his Ministry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <i class="calibre6">it</i>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <i class="calibre6">me</i> by his grace, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Accepted by Apostles and Others</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And they glorified God in me.</p></div></body></html>
