  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Released from the Law<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Galatians 3:15-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <i class="calibre6">her</i> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <i class="calibre6">her</i> husband. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>So then if, while <i class="calibre6">her</i> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <i class="calibre6">in</i> the oldness of the letter.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Law is Holy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>What shall we say then? <i class="calibre6">Is</i> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <i class="calibre6">was</i> dead. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the commandment, which <i class="calibre6">was ordained</i> to life, I found <i class="calibre6">to be</i> unto death. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <i class="calibre6">me</i>. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Wherefore the law <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>
<p class="hdg">Struggling with Sin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <i class="calibre6">it is</i> good. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <i class="calibre6">how</i> to perform that which is good I find not. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p></div></body></html>
