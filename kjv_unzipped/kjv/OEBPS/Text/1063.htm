  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Corinthians 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Paul, called <i class="calibre6">to be</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <i class="calibre6">our</i> brother,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i class="calibre6">to be</i> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Thanksgiving<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Philippians 1:3-11; Colossians 1:3-14; 2 Thessalonians 1:3-4)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> all knowledge; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <i class="calibre6">that ye may be</i> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>God <i class="calibre6">is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="hdg">Unity in the Church<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 133:1-3; Ephesians 4:1-16)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i class="calibre6">that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <i class="calibre6">which are of the house</i> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christ the Wisdom and Power of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the wise? where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the scribe? where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Foolish to Shame the Wise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <i class="calibre6">are called</i>: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <i class="calibre6">yea</i>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>That no flesh should glory in his presence. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
<span class="reftext">31</span>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p></div></body></html>
