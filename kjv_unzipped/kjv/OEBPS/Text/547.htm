  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Waters Have Come Up to My Neck!<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 27:32-44; Mark 15:21-32; Luke 23:26-43; John 19:16-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, <i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of David. Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto <i class="calibre6">my</i> soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I sink in deep mire, where <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, <i class="calibre6">being</i> mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored <i class="calibre6">that</i> which I took not away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>When I wept, <i class="calibre6">and chastened</i> my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I <i class="calibre6">was</i> the song of the drunkards.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But as for me, my prayer <i class="calibre6">is</i> unto thee, O LORD, <i class="calibre6">in</i> an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness <i class="calibre6">is</i> good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Draw nigh unto my soul, <i class="calibre6">and</i> redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries <i class="calibre6">are</i> all before thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked <i class="calibre6">for some</i> to take pity, but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Let their table become a snare before them: and <i class="calibre6">that which should have been</i> for <i class="calibre6">their</i> welfare, <i class="calibre6">let it become</i> a trap.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Let their habitation be desolate; <i class="calibre6">and</i> let none dwell in their tents.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For they persecute <i class="calibre6">him</i> whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>But I <i class="calibre6">am</i> poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span><i class="calibre6">This</i> also shall please the LORD better than an ox <i class="calibre6">or</i> bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>The humble shall see <i class="calibre6">this, and</i> be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p></div></body></html>
