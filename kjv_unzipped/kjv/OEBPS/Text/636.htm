  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Excellence of Wisdom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice <i class="calibre6">is</i> to the sons of man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> right things.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness <i class="calibre6">is</i> an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>All the words of my mouth <i class="calibre6">are</i> in righteousness; <i class="calibre6">there is</i> nothing froward or perverse in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>For wisdom <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The fear of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Counsel <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine, and sound wisdom: I <i class="calibre6">am</i> understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>By me princes rule, and nobles, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Riches and honour <i class="calibre6">are</i> with me; <i class="calibre6">yea</i>, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>My fruit <i class="calibre6">is</i> better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>When <i class="calibre6">there were</i> no depths, I was brought forth; when <i class="calibre6">there were</i> no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>When he prepared the heavens, I <i class="calibre6">was</i> there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Then I was by him, <i class="calibre6">as</i> one brought up <i class="calibre6">with him</i>: and I was daily <i class="calibre6">his</i> delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights <i class="calibre6">were</i> with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed <i class="calibre6">are they that</i> keep my ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p></div></body></html>
