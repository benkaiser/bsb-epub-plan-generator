  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Contend with Those who Contend with Me</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span><i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of David. Plead <i class="calibre6">my cause</i>, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Draw out also the spear, and stop <i class="calibre6">the way</i> against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> thy salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For without cause have they hid for me their net <i class="calibre6">in</i> a pit, <i class="calibre6">which</i> without cause they have digged for my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>All my bones shall say, LORD, who <i class="calibre6">is</i> like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge <i class="calibre6">things</i> that I knew not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They rewarded me evil for good <i class="calibre6">to</i> the spoiling of my soul.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing <i class="calibre6">was</i> sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I behaved myself as though <i class="calibre6">he had been</i> my friend <i class="calibre6">or</i> brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth <i class="calibre6">for his</i> mother.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: <i class="calibre6">yea</i>, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew <i class="calibre6">it</i> not; they did tear <i class="calibre6">me</i>, and ceased not:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: <i class="calibre6">neither</i> let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> quiet in the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, <i class="calibre6">and</i> said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span><i class="calibre6">This</i> thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify <i class="calibre6">themselves</i> against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness <i class="calibre6">and</i> of thy praise all the day long.</p></div></body></html>
