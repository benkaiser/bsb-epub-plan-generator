<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <i class="calibre6">that which is</i> planted;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Excellence in God's Works</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He hath made every <i class="calibre6">thing</i> beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I know that <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no good in them, but for <i class="calibre6">a man</i> to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <i class="calibre6">is</i> the gift of God. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth <i class="calibre6">it</i>, that <i class="calibre6">men</i> should fear before him. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>
<p class="hdg">From Dust to Dust</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <i class="calibre6">that</i> wickedness <i class="calibre6">was</i> there; and the place of righteousness, <i class="calibre6">that</i> iniquity <i class="calibre6">was</i> there. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Wherefore I perceive that <i class="calibre6">there is</i> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <i class="calibre6">is</i> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p></div></body></html>
