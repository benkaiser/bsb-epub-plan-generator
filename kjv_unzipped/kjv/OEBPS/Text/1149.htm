  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Taming the Tongue</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> a perfect man, <i class="calibre6">and</i> able also to bridle the whole body. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Behold also the ships, which though <i class="calibre6">they be</i> so great, and <i class="calibre6">are</i> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the tongue <i class="calibre6">is</i> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But the tongue can no man tame; <i class="calibre6">it is</i> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <i class="calibre6">water</i> and bitter? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so <i class="calibre6">can</i> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="hdg">True Wisdom from Above</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <i class="calibre6">is</i> earthly, sensual, devilish. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For where envying and strife <i class="calibre6">is</i>, there <i class="calibre6">is</i> confusion and every evil work. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <i class="calibre6">and</i> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</p></div></body></html>
