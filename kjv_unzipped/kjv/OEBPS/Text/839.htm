<span class="reftext">2</span>And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <i class="calibre6">there were</i> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <i class="calibre6">they were</i> very dry. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no breath in them. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Vision Explained</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and performed <i class="calibre6">it</i>, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">One Nation with One King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> all the house of Israel his companions: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou <i class="calibre6">meanest</i> by these? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, <i class="calibre6">even</i> with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land: 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions: but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And David my servant <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, <i class="calibre6">even</i> they, and their children, and their children's children for ever: and my servant David <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> their prince for ever. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.</p></div></body></html>
