  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Salvation for Zion</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock <i class="calibre6">whence</i> ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit <i class="calibre6">whence</i> ye are digged.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah <i class="calibre6">that</i> bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>My righteousness <i class="calibre6">is</i> near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart <i class="calibre6">is</i> my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. <i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou not it that hath cut Rahab, <i class="calibre6">and</i> wounded the dragon?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; <i class="calibre6">and</i> sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I, <i class="calibre6">even</i> I, <i class="calibre6">am</i> he that comforteth you: who <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall die, and of the son of man <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall be made <i class="calibre6">as</i> grass;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the fury of the oppressor?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my people.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Cup of Wrath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, <i class="calibre6">and</i> wrung <i class="calibre6">them</i> out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> none to guide her among all the sons <i class="calibre6">whom</i> she hath brought forth; neither <i class="calibre6">is there any</i> that taketh her by the hand of all the sons <i class="calibre6">that</i> she hath brought up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>These two <i class="calibre6">things</i> are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God <i class="calibre6">that</i> pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</p></div></body></html>
