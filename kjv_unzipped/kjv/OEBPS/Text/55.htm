  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Pharaoh's First Refusal</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Pharaoh said, Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now <i class="calibre6">are</i> many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</p>
<p class="hdg">Bricks and Straw</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish <i class="calibre6">ought</i> thereof: for they <i class="calibre6">be</i> idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go <i class="calibre6">and</i> sacrifice to our God. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the taskmasters hasted <i class="calibre6">them</i>, saying, Fulfil your works, <i class="calibre6">your</i> daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, <i class="calibre6">and</i> demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Israelites' Cry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
<span class="reftext">16</span>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants <i class="calibre6">are</i> beaten; but the fault <i class="calibre6">is</i> in thine own people. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But he said, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> idle, <i class="calibre6">ye are</i> idle: therefore ye say, Let us go <i class="calibre6">and</i> do sacrifice to the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Go therefore now, <i class="calibre6">and</i> work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the officers of the children of Israel did see <i class="calibre6">that</i> they <i class="calibre6">were</i> in evil <i class="calibre6">case</i>, after it was said, Ye shall not minish <i class="calibre6">ought</i> from your bricks of your daily task. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou <i class="calibre6">so</i> evil entreated this people? why <i class="calibre6">is</i> it <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou hast sent me? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</p></div></body></html>
