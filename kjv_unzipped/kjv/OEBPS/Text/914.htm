<span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <i class="calibre6">is</i> not this a brand plucked out of the fire? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</p></div></body></html>
