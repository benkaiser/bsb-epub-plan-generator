<span class="reftext">2</span>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Creation of Man</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> not a man to till the ground. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the LORD God formed man <i class="calibre6">of</i> the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Planting of the Garden</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>The name of the first <i class="calibre6">is</i> Pison: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where <i class="calibre6">there is</i> gold; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the gold of that land <i class="calibre6">is</i> good: there <i class="calibre6">is</i> bdellium and the onyx stone. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the name of the second river <i class="calibre6">is</i> Gihon: the same <i class="calibre6">is</i> it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the name of the third river <i class="calibre6">is</i> Hiddekel: that <i class="calibre6">is</i> it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river <i class="calibre6">is</i> Euphrates.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Forbidden Fruit</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>
<p class="hdg">Adam Names the Animals</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And the LORD God said, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought <i class="calibre6">them</i> unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that <i class="calibre6">was</i> the name thereof. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Creation of Woman</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And Adam said, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p></div></body></html>
