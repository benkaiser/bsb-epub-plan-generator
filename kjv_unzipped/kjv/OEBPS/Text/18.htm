<span class="reftext">2</span>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw <i class="calibre6">them</i>, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set <i class="calibre6">it</i> before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sarah Laughs at the Promise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And they said unto him, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard <i class="calibre6">it</i> in the tent door, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> behind him. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Now Abraham and Sarah <i class="calibre6">were</i> old <i class="calibre6">and</i> well stricken in age; <i class="calibre6">and</i> it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
<p class="hdg">Abraham Begs for Sodom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that <i class="calibre6">are</i> therein? 
<span class="reftext">25</span>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which <i class="calibre6">am but</i> dust and ashes: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for <i class="calibre6">lack of</i> five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do <i class="calibre6">it</i> for forty's sake. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And he said <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do <i class="calibre6">it</i>, if I find thirty there. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i class="calibre6">it</i> for twenty's sake. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy <i class="calibre6">it</i> for ten's sake. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p></div></body></html>
