<span class="reftext">2</span>Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Forbidding to marry, <i class="calibre6">and commanding</i> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For every creature of God <i class="calibre6">is</i> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Good Minister of Jesus Christ<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Leviticus 21:1-17)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself <i class="calibre6">rather</i> unto godliness. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>These things command and teach. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p></div></body></html>
