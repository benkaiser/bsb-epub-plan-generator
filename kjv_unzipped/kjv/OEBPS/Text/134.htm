<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of <i class="calibre6">their</i> fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> for the head of the house of their fathers. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, <i class="calibre6">even</i> twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron <i class="calibre6">was</i> among their rods. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Moses did <i class="calibre6">so</i>: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</p></div></body></html>
