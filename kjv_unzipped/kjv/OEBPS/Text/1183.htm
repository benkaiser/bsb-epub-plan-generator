<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <i class="calibre6">upon</i> them which worshipped his image.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <i class="calibre6">man</i>: and every living soul died in the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy judgments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i class="calibre6">come</i> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <i class="calibre6">which</i> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Seventh Bowl of Wrath</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i class="calibre6">and</i> so great. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i class="calibre6">every stone</i> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p></div></body></html>
