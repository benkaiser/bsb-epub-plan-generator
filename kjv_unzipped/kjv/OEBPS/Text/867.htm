  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Judgment on Israel and Judah</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment <i class="calibre6">is</i> toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I <i class="calibre6">have been</i> a rebuker of them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find <i class="calibre6">him</i>; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud <i class="calibre6">at</i> Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: <i class="calibre6">therefore</i> I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Ephraim <i class="calibre6">is</i> oppressed <i class="calibre6">and</i> broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore <i class="calibre6">will</i> I <i class="calibre6">be</i> unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah <i class="calibre6">saw</i> his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For I <i class="calibre6">will be</i> unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah: I, <i class="calibre6">even</i> I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue <i class="calibre6">him</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I will go <i class="calibre6">and</i> return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</p></div></body></html>
