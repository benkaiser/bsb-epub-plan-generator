  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job Laments his Birth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And Job spake, and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night <i class="calibre6">in which</i> it was said, There is a man child conceived.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but <i class="calibre6">have</i> none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Because it shut not up the doors of my <i class="calibre6">mother's</i> womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Why died I not from the womb? <i class="calibre6">why</i> did I <i class="calibre6">not</i> give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants <i class="calibre6">which</i> never saw light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>There the wicked cease <i class="calibre6">from</i> troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span><i class="calibre6">There</i> the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The small and great are there; and the servant <i class="calibre6">is</i> free from his master.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter <i class="calibre6">in</i> soul;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Which long for death, but it <i class="calibre6">cometh</i> not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Which rejoice exceedingly, <i class="calibre6">and</i> are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span><i class="calibre6">Why is light given</i> to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p></div></body></html>
