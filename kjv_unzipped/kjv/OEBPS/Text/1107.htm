  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Stand Firm in the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <i class="calibre6">my</i> dearly beloved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <i class="calibre6">with</i> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <i class="calibre6">are</i> in the book of life.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Rejoice in the Lord alway: <i class="calibre6">and</i> again I say, Rejoice. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i> at hand. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="hdg">Think on These Things</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <i class="calibre6">are</i> honest, whatsoever things <i class="calibre6">are</i> just, whatsoever things <i class="calibre6">are</i> pure, whatsoever things <i class="calibre6">are</i> lovely, whatsoever things <i class="calibre6">are</i> of good report; if <i class="calibre6">there be</i> any virtue, and if <i class="calibre6">there be</i> any praise, think on these things. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philippian Generosity</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <i class="calibre6">therewith</i> to be content. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <i class="calibre6">which were sent</i> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Now unto God and our Father <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Greetings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you all. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
