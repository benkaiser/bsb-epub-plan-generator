  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Habakkuk's Prayer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>O LORD, I have heard thy speech, <i class="calibre6">and</i> was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And <i class="calibre6">his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i class="calibre6">coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i class="calibre6">was</i> the hiding of his power.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <i class="calibre6">are</i> everlasting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <i class="calibre6">and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? <i class="calibre6">was</i> thine anger against the rivers? <i class="calibre6">was</i> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <i class="calibre6">and</i> thy chariots of salvation?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Thy bow was made quite naked, <i class="calibre6">according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i class="calibre6">even thy</i> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The mountains saw thee, <i class="calibre6">and</i> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <i class="calibre6">and</i> lifted up his hands on high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The sun <i class="calibre6">and</i> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <i class="calibre6">and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <i class="calibre6">even</i> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i class="calibre6">was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <i class="calibre6">through</i> the heap of great waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</p>
<p class="hdg">Habakkuk Rejoices</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i class="calibre6">shall</i> fruit <i class="calibre6">be</i> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i class="calibre6">there shall be</i> no herd in the stalls:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The LORD God <i class="calibre6">is</i> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds' <i class="calibre6">feet</i>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</p></div></body></html>
