  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Command to Leave Sinai<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 1:1-8)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, <i class="calibre6">and</i> go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Tent of Meeting</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> without the camp. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, <i class="calibre6">that</i> all the people rose up, and stood every man <i class="calibre6">at</i> his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood <i class="calibre6">at</i> the door of the tabernacle, and <i class="calibre6">the LORD</i> talked with Moses. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand <i class="calibre6">at</i> the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man <i class="calibre6">in</i> his tent door. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Glory of the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy people. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he said, My presence shall go <i class="calibre6">with thee</i>, and I will give thee rest. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And he said unto him, If thy presence go not <i class="calibre6">with me</i>, carry us not up hence. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? <i class="calibre6">is it</i> not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the LORD said, Behold, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</p></div></body></html>
