<span class="reftext">2</span>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's <i class="calibre6">son</i>, to betray him; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe <i class="calibre6">them</i> with the towel wherewith he was girded. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also <i class="calibre6">my</i> hands and <i class="calibre6">my</i> head. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash <i class="calibre6">his</i> feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for <i class="calibre6">so</i> I am. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>If I then, <i class="calibre6">your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>

<span class="reftext">19</span>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am <i class="calibre6">he</i>. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped <i class="calibre6">it</i>. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave <i class="calibre6">it</i> to Judas Iscariot, <i class="calibre6">the son</i> of Simon. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For some <i class="calibre6">of them</i> thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy <i class="calibre6">those things</i> that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</p>

<span class="reftext">32</span>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>By this shall all <i class="calibre6">men</i> know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</p>

<span class="reftext">37</span>Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</p></div></body></html>
