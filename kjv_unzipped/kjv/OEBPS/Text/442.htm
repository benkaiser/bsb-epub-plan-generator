  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job Replies: My Complaint is Just</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For the arrows of the Almighty <i class="calibre6">are</i> within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there <i class="calibre6">any</i> taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The things <i class="calibre6">that</i> my soul refused to touch <i class="calibre6">are</i> as my sorrowful meat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant <i class="calibre6">me</i> the thing that I long for!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>What <i class="calibre6">is</i> my strength, that I should hope? and what <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> my strength the strength of stones? or <i class="calibre6">is</i> my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>To him that is afflicted pity <i class="calibre6">should be shewed</i> from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, <i class="calibre6">and</i> as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Which are blackish by reason of the ice, <i class="calibre6">and</i> wherein the snow is hid:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For now ye are nothing; ye see <i class="calibre6">my</i> casting down, and are afraid.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, <i class="calibre6">which are</i> as wind?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig <i class="calibre6">a pit</i> for your friend.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Now therefore be content, look upon me; for <i class="calibre6">it is</i> evident unto you if I lie.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness <i class="calibre6">is</i> in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p></div></body></html>
