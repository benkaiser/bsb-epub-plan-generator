<span class="reftext">2</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of the herd, and of the flock. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>If his offering <i class="calibre6">be</i> a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that <i class="calibre6">is by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the fire which <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the altar: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, <i class="calibre6">to be</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And if his offering <i class="calibre6">be</i> of the flocks, <i class="calibre6">namely</i>, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that <i class="calibre6">is</i> on the fire which <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the altar: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring <i class="calibre6">it</i> all, and burn <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon the altar: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD <i class="calibre6">be</i> of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn <i class="calibre6">it</i> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, <i class="calibre6">but</i> shall not divide <i class="calibre6">it</i> asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the fire: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
