<span class="reftext">2</span>Upon the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <i class="calibre6">God</i> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <i class="calibre6">your</i> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Plans for Travel<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 15:23-33)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i class="calibre6">there are</i> many adversaries.</p>
<p class="hdg">Timothy Commended</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <i class="calibre6">do</i>. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>As touching <i class="calibre6">our</i> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</p>
<p class="hdg">Concluding Exhortations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Let all your things be done with charity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,) 
<span class="reftext">16</span>That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <i class="calibre6">us</i>, and laboureth. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</p>

<span class="reftext">20</span>All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The salutation of <i class="calibre6">me</i> Paul with mine own hand. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.
