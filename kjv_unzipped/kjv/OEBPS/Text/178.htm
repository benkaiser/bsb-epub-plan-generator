<span class="reftext">6</span>And it shall be, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother <i class="calibre6">which is</i> dead, that his name be not put out of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and <i class="calibre6">if</i> he stand <i class="calibre6">to it</i>, and say, I like not to take her;
