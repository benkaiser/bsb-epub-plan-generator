<span class="reftext">2</span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the <i class="calibre6">other</i> kine upon the brink of the river. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, <i class="calibre6">it was</i> a dream. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, <i class="calibre6">both</i> me and the chief baker: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And <i class="calibre6">there was</i> there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph Interprets Pharaoh's Dreams</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved <i class="calibre6">himself</i>, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they <i class="calibre6">were</i> still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, <i class="calibre6">and</i> blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told <i class="calibre6">this</i> unto the magicians; but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none that could declare <i class="calibre6">it</i> to me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh <i class="calibre6">is</i> one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he <i class="calibre6">is</i> about to do. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>The seven good kine <i class="calibre6">are</i> seven years; and the seven good ears <i class="calibre6">are</i> seven years: the dream <i class="calibre6">is</i> one. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them <i class="calibre6">are</i> seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God <i class="calibre6">is</i> about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> very grievous. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; <i class="calibre6">it is</i> because the thing <i class="calibre6">is</i> established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Let Pharaoh do <i class="calibre6">this</i>, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph Given Charge of Egypt</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find <i class="calibre6">such a one</i> as this <i class="calibre6">is</i>, a man in whom the Spirit of God <i class="calibre6">is</i>? 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none so discreet and wise as thou <i class="calibre6">art</i>: 
<span class="reftext">40</span>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him <i class="calibre6">ruler</i> over all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over <i class="calibre6">all</i> the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Seven Years of Plenty</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>And Joseph <i class="calibre6">was</i> thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">47</span>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which <i class="calibre6">was</i> round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for <i class="calibre6">it was</i> without number.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Sons of Joseph</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
<span class="reftext">51</span>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, <i class="calibre6">said he</i>, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Famine Begins</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">53</span>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
<span class="reftext">54</span>And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 
<span class="reftext">55</span>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
<span class="reftext">56</span>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">57</span>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy <i class="calibre6">corn</i>; because that the famine was <i class="calibre6">so</i> sore in all lands.</p></div></body></html>
