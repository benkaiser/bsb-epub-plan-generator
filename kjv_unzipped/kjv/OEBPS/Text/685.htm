<span class="reftext">2</span>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <i class="calibre6">is</i> full of his glory.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then said I, Woe <i class="calibre6">is</i> me! for I am undone; because I <i class="calibre6">am</i> a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, <i class="calibre6">which</i> he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>
<p class="hdg">Isaiah's Commission</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I; send me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the LORD have removed men far away, and <i class="calibre6">there be</i> a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>But yet in it <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> a tenth, and <i class="calibre6">it</i> shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance <i class="calibre6">is</i> in them, when they cast <i class="calibre6">their leaves: so</i> the holy seed <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the substance thereof.</p></div></body></html>
