  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Paul's Ministry in Corinth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews <i class="calibre6">that</i> Jesus <i class="calibre6">was</i> Christ. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <i class="calibre6">his</i> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <i class="calibre6">be</i> upon your own heads; I <i class="calibre6">am</i> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <i class="calibre6">man's</i> house, named Justus, <i class="calibre6">one</i> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And he continued <i class="calibre6">there</i> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Before Gallio</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Saying, This <i class="calibre6">fellow</i> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And when Paul was now about to open <i class="calibre6">his</i> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <i class="calibre6">ye</i> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>But if it be a question of words and names, and <i class="calibre6">of</i> your law, look ye <i class="calibre6">to it</i>; for I will be no judge of such <i class="calibre6">matters</i>. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he drave them from the judgment seat. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat <i class="calibre6">him</i> before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul Returns to Antioch</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Paul <i class="calibre6">after this</i> tarried <i class="calibre6">there</i> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <i class="calibre6">his</i> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>When they desired <i class="calibre6">him</i> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul's Third Missionary Journey<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Acts 13:1-3; Acts 15:36-41)</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And after he had spent some time <i class="calibre6">there</i>, he departed, and went over <i class="calibre6">all</i> the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>
<p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, <i class="calibre6">and</i> mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: 
<span class="reftext">28</span>For he mightily convinced the Jews, <i class="calibre6">and that</i> publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p></div></body></html>
