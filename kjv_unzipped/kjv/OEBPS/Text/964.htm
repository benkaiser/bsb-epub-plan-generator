  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Tradition and Vain Worship<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 15:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash <i class="calibre6">their</i> hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And <i class="calibre6">when they come</i> from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, <i class="calibre6">as</i> the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with <i class="calibre6">their</i> lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching <i class="calibre6">for</i> doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, <i class="calibre6">as</i> the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; <i class="calibre6">he shall be free</i>. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
<p class="hdg">What Defiles a Man<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 15:10-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And when he had called all the people <i class="calibre6">unto him</i>, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one <i class="calibre6">of you</i>, and understand: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, <i class="calibre6">it</i> cannot defile him; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 
<span class="reftext">23</span>All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Faith of the Syrophoenician Woman<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 15:21-28)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know <i class="calibre6">it</i>: but he could not be hid. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For a <i class="calibre6">certain</i> woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto the dogs. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Heals a Deaf and Mute Man<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 35:1-10; Matthew 9:32-34)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published <i class="calibre6">it</i>; 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p></div></body></html>
