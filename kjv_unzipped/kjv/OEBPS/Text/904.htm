<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i class="calibre6">even</i> cry out unto thee <i class="calibre6">of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <i class="calibre6">me</i> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <i class="calibre6">are</i> before me: and there are <i class="calibre6">that</i> raise up strife and contention.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord's Answer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i class="calibre6">I</i> will work a work in your days, <i class="calibre6">which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i class="calibre6">you</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i class="calibre6">that</i> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <i class="calibre6">that are</i> not theirs.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <i class="calibre6">that</i> hasteth to eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <i class="calibre6">as</i> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then shall <i class="calibre6">his</i> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <i class="calibre6">imputing</i> this his power unto his god.</p>
<p class="hdg">Habakkuk's Second Complaint<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 11:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span><i class="calibre6">Thou art</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <i class="calibre6">and</i> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <i class="calibre6">the man that is</i> more righteous than he?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <i class="calibre6">that have</i> no ruler over them?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <i class="calibre6">is</i> fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p></div></body></html>
