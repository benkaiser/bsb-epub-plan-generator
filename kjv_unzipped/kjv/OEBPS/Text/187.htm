And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the LORD said unto him, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see <i class="calibre6">it</i> with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Moses <i class="calibre6">was</i> an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping <i class="calibre6">and</i> mourning for Moses were ended.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</p></div></body></html>
