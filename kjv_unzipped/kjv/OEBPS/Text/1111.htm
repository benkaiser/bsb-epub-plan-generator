<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Let your speech <i class="calibre6">be</i> alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</p>

<span class="reftext">9</span>With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is <i class="calibre6">one</i> of you. They shall make known unto you all things which <i class="calibre6">are done</i> here.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;) 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only <i class="calibre6">are my</i> fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Epaphras, who is <i class="calibre6">one</i> of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them <i class="calibre6">that are</i> in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</p>
<p class="hdg">Sharing This Letter</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the <i class="calibre6">epistle</i> from Laodicea. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
