<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: <i class="calibre6">be they</i> better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>That chant to the sound of the viol, <i class="calibre6">and</i> invent to themselves instruments of musick, like David;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Pride of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him that <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the sides of the house, <i class="calibre6">Is there</i> yet <i class="calibre6">any</i> with thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Shall horses run upon the rock? will <i class="calibre6">one</i> plow <i class="calibre6">there</i> with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of the wilderness.</p></div></body></html>
