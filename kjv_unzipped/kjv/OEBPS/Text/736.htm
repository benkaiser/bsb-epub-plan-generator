<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, <i class="calibre6">each one</i> walking <i class="calibre6">in</i> his uprightness.</p>
<p class="hdg">God Condemns Idolatry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, <i class="calibre6">and</i> draw out the tongue? <i class="calibre6">are</i> ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Among the smooth <i class="calibre6">stones</i> of the stream <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy portion; they, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in these?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered <i class="calibre6">thyself to another</i> than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee <i class="calibre6">a covenant</i> with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase <i class="calibre6">thyself even</i> unto hell.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; <i class="calibre6">yet</i> saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid <i class="calibre6">it</i> to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take <i class="calibre6">them</i>: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name <i class="calibre6">is</i> Holy; I dwell in the high and holy <i class="calibre6">place</i>, with him also <i class="calibre6">that is</i> of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls <i class="calibre6">which</i> I have made.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> far off, and to <i class="calibre6">him that is</i> near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>But the wicked <i class="calibre6">are</i> like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p></div></body></html>
