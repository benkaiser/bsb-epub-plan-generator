  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">God's Power Shown in Creatures</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord <i class="calibre6">which</i> thou lettest down?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft <i class="calibre6">words</i> unto thee?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Wilt thou play with him as <i class="calibre6">with</i> a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not <i class="calibre6">one</i> be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>None <i class="calibre6">is so</i> fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Who hath prevented me, that I should repay <i class="calibre6">him? whatsoever is</i> under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Who can discover the face of his garment? <i class="calibre6">or</i> who can come <i class="calibre6">to him</i> with his double bridle?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth <i class="calibre6">are</i> terrible round about.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span><i class="calibre6">His</i> scales <i class="calibre6">are his</i> pride, shut up together <i class="calibre6">as with</i> a close seal.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes <i class="calibre6">are</i> like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, <i class="calibre6">and</i> sparks of fire leap out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as <i class="calibre6">out</i> of a seething pot or caldron.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether <i class="calibre6">millstone</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>He esteemeth iron as straw, <i class="calibre6">and</i> brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Sharp stones <i class="calibre6">are</i> under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>He maketh a path to shine after him; <i class="calibre6">one</i> would think the deep <i class="calibre6">to be</i> hoary.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>He beholdeth all high <i class="calibre6">things</i>: he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a king over all the children of pride.</p></div></body></html>
