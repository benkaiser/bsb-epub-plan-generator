<span class="reftext">2</span>For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore let us not sleep, as <i class="calibre6">do</i> others; but let us watch and be sober. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>
<p class="hdg">Christian Living</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. <i class="calibre6">And</i> be at peace among yourselves. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <i class="calibre6">men</i>. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>See that none render evil for evil unto any <i class="calibre6">man</i>; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all <i class="calibre6">men</i>. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Rejoice evermore. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Pray without ceasing. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Quench not the Spirit. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Despise not prophesyings. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Blessings</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <i class="calibre6">I pray God</i> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Faithful <i class="calibre6">is</i> he that calleth you, who also will do <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
