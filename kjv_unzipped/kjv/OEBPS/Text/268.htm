<span class="reftext">2</span>It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and <i class="calibre6">so</i> it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he said unto me, Who <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou? And I answered him, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> an Amalekite. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life <i class="calibre6">is</i> yet whole in me. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon his head, and the bracelet that <i class="calibre6">was</i> on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that <i class="calibre6">were</i> with him: 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou? And he answered, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, <i class="calibre6">and</i> fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And David said unto him, Thy blood <i class="calibre6">be</i> upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Song for Saul and Jonathan</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah <i class="calibre6">the use of</i> the bow: behold, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Tell <i class="calibre6">it</i> not in Gath, publish <i class="calibre6">it</i> not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Ye mountains of Gilboa, <i class="calibre6">let there be</i> no dew, neither <i class="calibre6">let there be</i> rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, <i class="calibre6">as though he had</i> not <i class="calibre6">been</i> anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Saul and Jonathan <i class="calibre6">were</i> lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with <i class="calibre6">other</i> delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, <i class="calibre6">thou wast</i> slain in thine high places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p></div></body></html>
