  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Retribution for Israel's Sin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Israel <i class="calibre6">is</i> an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof <i class="calibre6">that</i> rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>It shall be also carried unto Assyria <i class="calibre6">for</i> a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And Ephraim <i class="calibre6">is as</i> an heifer <i class="calibre6">that is</i> taught, <i class="calibre6">and</i> loveth to tread out <i class="calibre6">the corn</i>; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, <i class="calibre6">and</i> Jacob shall break his clods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for <i class="calibre6">it is</i> time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon <i class="calibre6">her</i> children.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</p></div></body></html>
