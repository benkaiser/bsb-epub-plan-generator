<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from <i class="calibre6">being</i> a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Do unto them as <i class="calibre6">unto</i> the Midianites; as <i class="calibre6">to</i> Sisera, as <i class="calibre6">to</i> Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">Which</i> perished at Endor: they became <i class="calibre6">as</i> dung for the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>That <i class="calibre6">men</i> may know that thou, whose name alone <i class="calibre6">is</i> JEHOVAH, <i class="calibre6">art</i> the most high over all the earth.</p></div></body></html>
