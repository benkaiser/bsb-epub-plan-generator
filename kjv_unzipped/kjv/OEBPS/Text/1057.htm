  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Remnant of Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i class="calibre6">of</i> the tribe of Benjamin. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <i class="calibre6">the image of</i> Baal. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And if by grace, then <i class="calibre6">is it</i> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <i class="calibre6">it be</i> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Ingrafting of the Gentiles</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <i class="calibre6">rather</i> through their fall salvation <i class="calibre6">is come</i> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Now if the fall of them <i class="calibre6">be</i> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office: 
<span class="reftext">14</span>If by any means I may provoke to emulation <i class="calibre6">them which are</i> my flesh, and might save some of them. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For if the casting away of them <i class="calibre6">be</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i class="calibre6">shall</i> the receiving <i class="calibre6">of them be</i>, but life from the dead? 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For if the firstfruit <i class="calibre6">be</i> holy, the lump <i class="calibre6">is</i> also <i class="calibre6">holy</i>: and if the root <i class="calibre6">be</i> holy, so <i class="calibre6">are</i> the branches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For if God spared not the natural branches, <i class="calibre6">take heed</i> lest he also spare not thee. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <i class="calibre6">his</i> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <i class="calibre6">branches</i>, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
<p class="hdg">All Israel Shall Be Saved</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>As concerning the gospel, <i class="calibre6">they are</i> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <i class="calibre6">they are</i> beloved for the fathers' sakes. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For the gifts and calling of God <i class="calibre6">are</i> without repentance. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
<p class="hdg">Doxology<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 16:25-27; Jude 1:24-25)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <i class="calibre6">are</i> his judgments, and his ways past finding out! 
<span class="reftext">34</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 
<span class="reftext">36</span>For of him, and through him, and to him, <i class="calibre6">are</i> all things: to whom <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory for ever. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
