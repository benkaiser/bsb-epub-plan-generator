<span class="reftext">2</span>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i class="calibre6">of wine</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And he appointed <i class="calibre6">certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">David's Psalm of Thanksgiving<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 95:1-11; Psalm 105:1-45; Psalm 106:1-48)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then on that day David delivered first <i class="calibre6">this psalm</i> to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>He <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD our God; his judgments <i class="calibre6">are</i> in all the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word <i class="calibre6">which</i> he commanded to a thousand generations;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">Even of the covenant</i> which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, <i class="calibre6">and</i> to Israel <i class="calibre6">for</i> an everlasting covenant,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And <i class="calibre6">when</i> they went from nation to nation, and from <i class="calibre6">one</i> kingdom to another people;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span><i class="calibre6">Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>For great <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also <i class="calibre6">is</i> to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>For all the gods of the people <i class="calibre6">are</i> idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Glory and honour <i class="calibre6">are</i> in his presence; strength and gladness <i class="calibre6">are</i> in his place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Give unto the LORD the glory <i class="calibre6">due</i> unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let <i class="calibre6">men</i> say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i class="calibre6">he is</i> good; for his mercy <i class="calibre6">endureth</i> for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, <i class="calibre6">and</i> glory in thy praise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Worship Before the Ark</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah <i class="calibre6">to be</i> porters: 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that <i class="calibre6">was</i> at Gibeon, 
<span class="reftext">40</span>To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and <i class="calibre6">to do</i> according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy <i class="calibre6">endureth</i> for ever; 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun <i class="calibre6">were</i> porters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p></div></body></html>
