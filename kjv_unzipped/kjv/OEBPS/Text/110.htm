<span class="reftext">3</span>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:
