  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Obey the King</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> as the wise <i class="calibre6">man</i>? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I <i class="calibre6">counsel thee</i> to keep the king's commandment, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> in regard of the oath of God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Where the word of a king <i class="calibre6">is, there is</i> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <i class="calibre6">is</i> great upon him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 
<span class="reftext">8</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <i class="calibre6">hath he</i> power in the day of death: and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no discharge in <i class="calibre6">that</i> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
<p class="hdg">Fear God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this <i class="calibre6">is</i> also vanity. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <i class="calibre6">days</i> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <i class="calibre6">his</i> days, <i class="calibre6">which are</i> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Ways are Mysterious</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <i class="calibre6">men</i>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <i class="calibre6">men</i>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <i class="calibre6">there is that</i> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <i class="calibre6">it</i> out, yet he shall not find <i class="calibre6">it</i>; yea further; though a wise <i class="calibre6">man</i> think to know <i class="calibre6">it</i>, yet shall he not be able to find <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
