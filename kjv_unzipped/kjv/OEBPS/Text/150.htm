<span class="reftext">2</span>And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these <i class="calibre6">are</i> their journeys according to their goings out. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For the Egyptians buried all <i class="calibre6">their</i> firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the edge of the wilderness.

<p class="hdg">Canaanites to Be Destroyed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i class="calibre6">near</i> Jericho, saying, 
<span class="reftext">51</span>Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 
<span class="reftext">52</span>Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places: 
<span class="reftext">53</span>And ye shall dispossess <i class="calibre6">the inhabitants of</i> the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. 
<span class="reftext">54</span>And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: <i class="calibre6">and</i> to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's <i class="calibre6">inheritance</i> shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. 
<span class="reftext">55</span>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
<span class="reftext">56</span>Moreover it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.</p></div></body></html>
