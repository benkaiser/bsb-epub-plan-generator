<span class="reftext">2</span>And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto this very day. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For <i class="calibre6">they are</i> impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns <i class="calibre6">be</i> with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they <i class="calibre6">be</i> a rebellious house. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> most rebellious.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And when I looked, behold, an hand <i class="calibre6">was</i> sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book <i class="calibre6">was</i> therein; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he spread it before me; and it <i class="calibre6">was</i> written within and without: and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p></div></body></html>
