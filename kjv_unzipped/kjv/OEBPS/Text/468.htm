<span class="reftext">2</span>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and <i class="calibre6">yet</i> had condemned Job. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they <i class="calibre6">were</i> elder than he. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>When Elihu saw that <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no answer in the mouth of <i class="calibre6">these</i> three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> young, and ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Great men are not <i class="calibre6">always</i> wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none of you that convinced Job, <i class="calibre6">or</i> that answered his words:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now he hath not directed <i class="calibre6">his</i> words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, <i class="calibre6">and</i> answered no more;)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span><i class="calibre6">I said</i>, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Behold, my belly <i class="calibre6">is</i> as wine <i class="calibre6">which</i> hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I know not to give flattering titles; <i class="calibre6">in so doing</i> my maker would soon take me away.</p></div></body></html>
