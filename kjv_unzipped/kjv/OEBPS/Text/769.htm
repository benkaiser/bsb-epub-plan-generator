<span class="reftext">2</span>One basket <i class="calibre6">had</i> very good figs, <i class="calibre6">even</i> like the figs <i class="calibre6">that are</i> first ripe: and the other basket <i class="calibre6">had</i> very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for <i class="calibre6">their</i> good. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull <i class="calibre6">them</i> down; and I will plant them, and not pluck <i class="calibre6">them</i> up. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I will give them an heart to know me, that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for <i class="calibre6">their</i> hurt, <i class="calibre6">to be</i> a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.</p></div></body></html>
