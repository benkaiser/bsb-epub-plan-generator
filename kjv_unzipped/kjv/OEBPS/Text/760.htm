  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgment to Continue</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> my mind <i class="calibre6">could</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> toward this people: cast <i class="calibre6">them</i> out of my sight, and let them go forth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as <i class="calibre6">are</i> for death, to death; and such as <i class="calibre6">are</i> for the sword, to the sword; and such as <i class="calibre6">are</i> for the famine, to the famine; and such as <i class="calibre6">are</i> for the captivity, to the captivity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for <i class="calibre6">that</i> which he did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave <i class="calibre6">them</i> of children, I will destroy my people, <i class="calibre6">since</i> they return not from their ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused <i class="calibre6">him</i> to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while <i class="calibre6">it was</i> yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jeremiah's Complaint</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; <i class="calibre6">yet</i> every one of them doth curse me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <i class="calibre6">well</i> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And I will make <i class="calibre6">thee</i> to pass with thine enemies into a land <i class="calibre6">which</i> thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall burn upon you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <i class="calibre6">which</i> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <i class="calibre6">and as</i> waters <i class="calibre6">that</i> fail?</p>
<p class="hdg">The Lord's Promise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <i class="calibre6">and</i> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I <i class="calibre6">am</i> with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</p></div></body></html>
