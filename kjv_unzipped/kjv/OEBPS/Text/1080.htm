  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Reaffirm Your Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <i class="calibre6">the joy</i> of you all. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Sufficient to such a man <i class="calibre6">is</i> this punishment, which <i class="calibre6">was inflicted</i> of many. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>So that contrariwise ye <i class="calibre6">ought</i> rather to forgive <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and comfort <i class="calibre6">him</i>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <i class="calibre6">your</i> love toward him. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>To whom ye forgive any thing, I <i class="calibre6">forgive</i> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <i class="calibre6">it</i>, for your sakes <i class="calibre6">forgave I it</i> in the person of Christ; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
<p class="hdg">Triumph in Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i class="calibre6">preach</i> Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
<span class="reftext">13</span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now thanks <i class="calibre6">be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>To the one <i class="calibre6">we are</i> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <i class="calibre6">is</i> sufficient for these things? 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p></div></body></html>
