  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">I Will Give Thanks to the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise <i class="calibre6">thee</i>, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble <i class="calibre6">which I suffer</i> of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>The heathen are sunk down in the pit <i class="calibre6">that</i> they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The LORD is known <i class="calibre6">by</i> the judgment <i class="calibre6">which</i> he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>The wicked shall be turned into hell, <i class="calibre6">and</i> all the nations that forget God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall <i class="calibre6">not</i> perish for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Put them in fear, O LORD: <i class="calibre6">that</i> the nations may know themselves <i class="calibre6">to be but</i> men. Selah.</p></div></body></html>
