  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Imitators of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Children of Light</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i class="calibre6">are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>(For the fruit of the Spirit <i class="calibre6">is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i class="calibre6">them</i>. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i>. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="hdg">Wives and Husbands<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Song of Solomon 1:1-3; 1 Peter 3:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i class="calibre6">let</i> the wives <i class="calibre6">be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 
<span class="reftext">27</span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: 
<span class="reftext">30</span>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <i class="calibre6">see</i> that she reverence <i class="calibre6">her</i> husband.</p></div></body></html>
