<span class="reftext">2</span>And when Jacob saw them, he said, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the mother with the children. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he delivered <i class="calibre6">them</i> into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou? and whither goest thou? and whose <i class="calibre6">are</i> these before thee? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Then thou shalt say, <i class="calibre6">They be</i> thy servant Jacob's; it <i class="calibre6">is</i> a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he <i class="calibre6">is</i> behind us. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob <i class="calibre6">is</i> behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jacob Wrestles with God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he said unto him, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And Jacob asked <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and said, Tell <i class="calibre6">me</i>, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore <i class="calibre6">is</i> it <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Therefore the children of Israel eat not <i class="calibre6">of</i> the sinew which shrank, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p></div></body></html>
