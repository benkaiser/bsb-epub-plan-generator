<span class="reftext">2</span>And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof <i class="calibre6">was</i> threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty <i class="calibre6">cubits</i>, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits <i class="calibre6">was</i> the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; <i class="calibre6">and</i> ten cubits <i class="calibre6">was</i> the breadth thereof before the house. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Chambers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, <i class="calibre6">against</i> the walls of the house round about, <i class="calibre6">both</i> of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>The nethermost chamber <i class="calibre6">was</i> five cubits broad, and the middle <i class="calibre6">was</i> six cubits broad, and the third <i class="calibre6">was</i> seven cubits broad: for without <i class="calibre6">in the wall</i> of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that <i class="calibre6">the beams</i> should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe <i class="calibre6">nor</i> any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The door for the middle chamber <i class="calibre6">was</i> in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle <i class="calibre6">chamber</i>, and out of the middle into the third. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And <i class="calibre6">then</i> he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Promise</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 
<span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">Concerning</i> this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Temple's Interior</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: <i class="calibre6">and</i> he covered <i class="calibre6">them</i> on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built <i class="calibre6">them</i> for it within, <i class="calibre6">even</i> for the oracle, <i class="calibre6">even</i> for the most holy <i class="calibre6">place</i>. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the house, that <i class="calibre6">is</i>, the temple before it, was forty cubits <i class="calibre6">long</i>. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the cedar of the house within <i class="calibre6">was</i> carved with knops and open flowers: all <i class="calibre6">was</i> cedar; there was no stone seen. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the oracle in the forepart <i class="calibre6">was</i> twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and <i class="calibre6">so</i> covered the altar <i class="calibre6">which was of</i> cedar. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that <i class="calibre6">was</i> by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Cherubim<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(2 Chronicles 3:11-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And within the oracle he made two cherubims <i class="calibre6">of</i> olive tree, <i class="calibre6">each</i> ten cubits high. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And five cubits <i class="calibre6">was</i> the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other <i class="calibre6">were</i> ten cubits. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And the other cherub <i class="calibre6">was</i> ten cubits: both the cherubims <i class="calibre6">were</i> of one measure and one size. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>The height of the one cherub <i class="calibre6">was</i> ten cubits, and so <i class="calibre6">was it</i> of the other cherub. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the <i class="calibre6">one</i> wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Doors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors <i class="calibre6">of</i> olive tree: the lintel <i class="calibre6">and</i> side posts <i class="calibre6">were</i> a fifth part <i class="calibre6">of the wall</i>. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>The two doors also <i class="calibre6">were of</i> olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid <i class="calibre6">them</i> with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>So also made he for the door of the temple posts <i class="calibre6">of</i> olive tree, a fourth part <i class="calibre6">of the wall</i>. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>And the two doors <i class="calibre6">were of</i> fir tree: the two leaves of the one door <i class="calibre6">were</i> folding, and the two leaves of the other door <i class="calibre6">were</i> folding. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And he carved <i class="calibre6">thereon</i> cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered <i class="calibre6">them</i> with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Courtyard</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif: 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</p></div></body></html>
