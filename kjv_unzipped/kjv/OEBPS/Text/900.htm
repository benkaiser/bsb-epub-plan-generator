  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Israel's Great Misery</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The good <i class="calibre6">man</i> is perished out of the earth: and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i class="calibre6">asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i class="calibre6">man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The best of them <i class="calibre6">is</i> as a brier: the most upright <i class="calibre6">is sharper</i> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <i class="calibre6">and</i> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies <i class="calibre6">are</i> the men of his own house.</p>
<p class="hdg">Israel Looks to the Lord</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> a light unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, <i class="calibre6">and</i> I shall behold his righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Then <i class="calibre6">she that is</i> mine enemy shall see <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">In</i> the day that thy walls are to be built, <i class="calibre6">in</i> that day shall the decree be far removed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span><i class="calibre6">In</i> that day <i class="calibre6">also</i> he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and <i class="calibre6">from</i> mountain to mountain.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Compassion on Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily <i class="calibre6">in</i> the wood, in the midst of Carmel: let them feed <i class="calibre6">in</i> Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous <i class="calibre6">things</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might: they shall lay <i class="calibre6">their</i> hand upon <i class="calibre6">their</i> mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth <i class="calibre6">in</i> mercy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</p></div></body></html>
