  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Judgments and Promises</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I am sought of <i class="calibre6">them that</i> asked not <i class="calibre6">for me</i>; I am found of <i class="calibre6">them that</i> sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation <i class="calibre6">that</i> was not called by my name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way <i class="calibre6">that was</i> not good, after their own thoughts;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable <i class="calibre6">things is in</i> their vessels;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These <i class="calibre6">are</i> a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Behold, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and <i class="calibre6">one</i> saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing <i class="calibre6">is</i> in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose <i class="calibre6">that</i> wherein I delighted not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="hdg">New Heavens and Earth</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever <i class="calibre6">in that</i> which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner <i class="calibre6">being</i> an hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>And they shall build houses, and inhabit <i class="calibre6">them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree <i class="calibre6">are</i> the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
