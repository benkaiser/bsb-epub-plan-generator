  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord Calls Samuel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; <i class="calibre6">there was</i> no open vision.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli <i class="calibre6">was</i> laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, <i class="calibre6">that</i> he could not see; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God <i class="calibre6">was</i>, and Samuel was laid down <i class="calibre6">to sleep</i>; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Judgment against Eli</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all <i class="calibre6">things</i> which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
<p class="hdg">Samuel Shares his Vision</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here <i class="calibre6">am</i> I. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said, What <i class="calibre6">is</i> the thing that <i class="calibre6">the LORD</i> hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide <i class="calibre6">it</i> not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide <i class="calibre6">any</i> thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It <i class="calibre6">is</i> the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel <i class="calibre6">was</i> established <i class="calibre6">to be</i> a prophet of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
