<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And this <i class="calibre6">is</i> the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, <i class="calibre6">that were</i> males, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people <i class="calibre6">that were</i> born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, <i class="calibre6">them</i> they had not circumcised. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people <i class="calibre6">that were</i> men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And their children, <i class="calibre6">whom</i> he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Passover at Gilgal</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched <i class="calibre6">corn</i> in the selfsame day. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, <i class="calibre6">Art</i> thou for us, or for our adversaries? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And he said, Nay; but <i class="calibre6">as</i> captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy. And Joshua did so.</p></div></body></html>
