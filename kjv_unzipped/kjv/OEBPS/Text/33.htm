And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who <i class="calibre6">are</i> those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And he said, What <i class="calibre6">meanest</i> thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, <i class="calibre6">These are</i> to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children <i class="calibre6">are</i> tender, and the flocks and herds with young <i class="calibre6">are</i> with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee <i class="calibre6">some</i> of the folk that <i class="calibre6">are</i> with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jacob Settles in Shechem</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</p></div></body></html>
