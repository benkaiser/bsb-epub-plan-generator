  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Evil in the Last Days</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="hdg">All Scripture is God-Breathed</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience, 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i class="calibre6">them</i> all the Lord delivered me. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i class="calibre6">them</i>; 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>All scripture <i class="calibre6">is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i class="calibre6">is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</p></div></body></html>
