<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, <i class="calibre6">though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <i class="calibre6">that is</i> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <i class="calibre6">have been</i> from of old, from everlasting.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore will he give them up, until the time <i class="calibre6">that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And this <i class="calibre6">man</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</p>

<p class="hdg">The Remnant of Jacob</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</p>
