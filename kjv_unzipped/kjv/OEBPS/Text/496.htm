  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord is My Rock<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 27:1-14; Psalm 28:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>To the chief Musician, <i class="calibre6">A Psalm</i> of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day <i class="calibre6">that</i> the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, <i class="calibre6">and</i> my high tower.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I will call upon the LORD, <i class="calibre6">who is worthy</i> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, <i class="calibre6">even</i> into his ears.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness <i class="calibre6">was</i> under his feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him <i class="calibre6">were</i> dark waters <i class="calibre6">and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>At the brightness <i class="calibre6">that was</i> before him his thick clouds passed, hail <i class="calibre6">stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail <i class="calibre6">stones</i> and coals of fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For all his judgments <i class="calibre6">were</i> before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> God, his way <i class="calibre6">is</i> perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>For who <i class="calibre6">is</i> God save the LORD? or who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a rock save our God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>He maketh my feet like hinds' <i class="calibre6">feet</i>, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>They cried, but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none to save <i class="calibre6">them: even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; <i class="calibre6">and</i> thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people <i class="calibre6">whom</i> I have not known shall serve me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span><i class="calibre6">It is</i> God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">49</span>Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p></div></body></html>
