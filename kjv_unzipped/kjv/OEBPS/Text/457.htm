  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Job: God will Deal with the Wicked</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>As for me, <i class="calibre6">is</i> my complaint to man? and if <i class="calibre6">it were so</i>, why should not my spirit be troubled?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Mark me, and be astonished, and lay <i class="calibre6">your</i> hand upon <i class="calibre6">your</i> mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Their houses <i class="calibre6">are</i> safe from fear, neither <i class="calibre6">is</i> the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>What <i class="calibre6">is</i> the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Lo, their good <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and <i class="calibre6">how oft</i> cometh their destruction upon them! <i class="calibre6">God</i> distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For what pleasure <i class="calibre6">hath</i> he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Shall <i class="calibre6">any</i> teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices <i class="calibre6">which</i> ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>For ye say, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> the house of the prince? and where <i class="calibre6">are</i> the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him <i class="calibre6">what</i> he hath done?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as <i class="calibre6">there are</i> innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</p></div></body></html>
