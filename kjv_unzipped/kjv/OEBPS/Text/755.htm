  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Sovereignty of God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For the customs of the people <i class="calibre6">are</i> vain: for <i class="calibre6">one</i> cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also <i class="calibre6">is it</i> in them to do good.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Forasmuch as <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none like unto thee, O LORD; thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> great, and thy name <i class="calibre6">is</i> great in might.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise <i class="calibre6">men</i> of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none like unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <i class="calibre6">is</i> a doctrine of vanities.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple <i class="calibre6">is</i> their clothing: they <i class="calibre6">are</i> all the work of cunning <i class="calibre6">men</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> the true God, he <i class="calibre6">is</i> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, <i class="calibre6">even</i> they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>When he uttereth his voice, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Every man is brutish in <i class="calibre6">his</i> knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image <i class="calibre6">is</i> falsehood, and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no breath in them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>They <i class="calibre6">are</i> vanity, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>The portion of Jacob <i class="calibre6">is</i> not like them: for he <i class="calibre6">is</i> the former of all <i class="calibre6">things</i>; and Israel <i class="calibre6">is</i> the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Coming Destruction</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find <i class="calibre6">it so</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this <i class="calibre6">is</i> a grief, and I must bear it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they <i class="calibre6">are</i> not: <i class="calibre6">there is</i> none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a den of dragons.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jeremiah's Prayer</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>O LORD, I know that the way of man <i class="calibre6">is</i> not in himself: <i class="calibre6">it is</i> not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</p></div></body></html>
