Hear this, all <i class="calibre6">ye</i> people; give ear, all <i class="calibre6">ye</i> inhabitants of the world:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> of understanding.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, <i class="calibre6">when</i> the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>None <i class="calibre6">of them</i> can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>(For the redemption of their soul <i class="calibre6">is</i> precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>That he should still live for ever, <i class="calibre6">and</i> not see corruption.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For he seeth <i class="calibre6">that</i> wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Their inward thought <i class="calibre6">is, that</i> their houses <i class="calibre6">shall continue</i> for ever, <i class="calibre6">and</i> their dwelling places to all generations; they call <i class="calibre6">their</i> lands after their own names.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Nevertheless man <i class="calibre6">being</i> in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts <i class="calibre6">that</i> perish.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>This their way <i class="calibre6">is</i> their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and <i class="calibre6">men</i> will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Man <i class="calibre6">that is</i> in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts <i class="calibre6">that</i> perish.</p></div></body></html>
