<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Then shall we know, <i class="calibre6">if</i> we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter <i class="calibre6">and</i> former rain unto the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness <i class="calibre6">is</i> as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Therefore have I hewed <i class="calibre6">them</i> by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments <i class="calibre6">are as</i> the light <i class="calibre6">that</i> goeth forth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Gilead <i class="calibre6">is</i> a city of them that work iniquity, <i class="calibre6">and is</i> polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And as troops of robbers wait for a man, <i class="calibre6">so</i> the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there <i class="calibre6">is</i> the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</p></div></body></html>
