<span class="reftext">2</span>And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
<p class="hdg">Cain Murders Abel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the LORD said unto Cain, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: <i class="calibre6">Am</i> I my brother's keeper? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And now <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment <i class="calibre6">is</i> greater than I can bear. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> every one that findeth me shall slay me. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Descendants of Cain</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one <i class="calibre6">was</i> Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and <i class="calibre6">of such as have</i> cattle. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And his brother's name <i class="calibre6">was</i> Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain <i class="calibre6">was</i> Naamah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</p>
<p class="hdg">Seth and Enosh</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, <i class="calibre6">said she</i>, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
