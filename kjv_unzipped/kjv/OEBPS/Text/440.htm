  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Eliphaz: the Innocent Prosper</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span><i class="calibre6">If</i> we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not <i class="calibre6">this</i> thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Remember, I pray thee, who <i class="calibre6">ever</i> perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image <i class="calibre6">was</i> before mine eyes, <i class="calibre6">there was</i> silence, and I heard a voice, <i class="calibre6">saying</i>,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>How much less <i class="calibre6">in</i> them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation <i class="calibre6">is</i> in the dust, <i class="calibre6">which</i> are crushed before the moth?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Doth not their excellency <i class="calibre6">which is</i> in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p></div></body></html>
