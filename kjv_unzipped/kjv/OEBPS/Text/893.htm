<span class="reftext">2</span>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, <i class="calibre6">was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <i class="calibre6">it is</i> better for me to die than to live. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made <i class="calibre6">it</i> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <i class="calibre6">It is</i> better for me to die than to live.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto death. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <i class="calibre6">also</i> much cattle?</p></div></body></html>
