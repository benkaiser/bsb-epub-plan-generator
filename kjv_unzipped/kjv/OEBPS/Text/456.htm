<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for <i class="calibre6">this</i> I make haste.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Knowest thou <i class="calibre6">not</i> this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>That the triumphing of the wicked <i class="calibre6">is</i> short, and the joy of the hypocrite <i class="calibre6">but</i> for a moment?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span><i class="calibre6">Yet</i> he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> he?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The eye also <i class="calibre6">which</i> saw him shall <i class="calibre6">see him</i> no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>His bones are full <i class="calibre6">of the sin</i> of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, <i class="calibre6">though</i> he hide it under his tongue;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span><i class="calibre6">Though</i> he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span><i class="calibre6">Yet</i> his meat in his bowels is turned, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow <i class="calibre6">it</i> down: according to <i class="calibre6">his</i> substance <i class="calibre6">shall</i> the restitution <i class="calibre6">be</i>, and he shall not rejoice <i class="calibre6">therein</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>Because he hath oppressed <i class="calibre6">and</i> hath forsaken the poor; <i class="calibre6">because</i> he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span><i class="calibre6">When</i> he is about to fill his belly, <i class="calibre6">God</i> shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain <i class="calibre6">it</i> upon him while he is eating.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>He shall flee from the iron weapon, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the bow of steel shall strike him through.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>All darkness <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>The increase of his house shall depart, <i class="calibre6">and his goods</i> shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p></div></body></html>
