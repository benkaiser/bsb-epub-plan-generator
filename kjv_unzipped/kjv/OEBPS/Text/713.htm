<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>For the indignation of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> upon all nations, and <i class="calibre6">his</i> fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling <i class="calibre6">fig</i> from the fig tree.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For <i class="calibre6">it is</i> the day of the LORD'S vengeance, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> there, and all her princes shall be nothing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a court for owls.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with her mate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</p></div></body></html>
