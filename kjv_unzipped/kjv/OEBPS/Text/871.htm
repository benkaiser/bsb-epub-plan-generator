  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Hosea Announces Israel's Punishment</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as <i class="calibre6">other</i> people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>They shall not dwell in the LORD'S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean <i class="calibre6">things</i> in Assyria.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They shall not offer wine <i class="calibre6">offerings</i> to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant <i class="calibre6">places</i> for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in their tabernacles.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know <i class="calibre6">it</i>: the prophet <i class="calibre6">is</i> a fool, the spiritual man <i class="calibre6">is</i> mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>The watchman of Ephraim <i class="calibre6">was</i> with my God: <i class="calibre6">but</i> the prophet <i class="calibre6">is</i> a snare of a fowler in all his ways, <i class="calibre6">and</i> hatred in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They have deeply corrupted <i class="calibre6">themselves</i>, as in the days of Gibeah: <i class="calibre6">therefore</i> he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: <i class="calibre6">but</i> they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto <i class="calibre6">that</i> shame; and <i class="calibre6">their</i> abominations were according as they loved.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, <i class="calibre6">that there shall</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> a man <i class="calibre6">left</i>: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, <i class="calibre6">is</i> planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>All their wickedness <i class="calibre6">is</i> in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will love them no more: all their princes <i class="calibre6">are</i> revolters.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay <i class="calibre6">even</i> the beloved <i class="calibre6">fruit</i> of their womb.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p></div></body></html>
