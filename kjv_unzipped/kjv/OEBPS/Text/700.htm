  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Babylon is Fallen</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; <i class="calibre6">so</i> it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing <i class="calibre6">of it</i>; I was dismayed at the seeing <i class="calibre6">of it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, <i class="calibre6">and</i> anoint the shield.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And he saw a chariot <i class="calibre6">with</i> a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, <i class="calibre6">and</i> a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <i class="calibre6">with</i> a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Edom</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Prophecy against Arabia</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p></div></body></html>
