<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>I will utterly consume all <i class="calibre6">things</i> from off the land, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, <i class="calibre6">and</i> the name of the Chemarims with the priests;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship <i class="calibre6">and</i> that swear by the LORD, and that swear by Malcham;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And them that are turned back from the LORD; and <i class="calibre6">those</i> that have not sought the LORD, nor inquired for him.</p>

<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD'S sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and deceit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, <i class="calibre6">that there shall be</i> the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And it shall come to pass at that time, <i class="calibre6">that</i> I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit <i class="calibre6">them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The great day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> near, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> near, and hasteth greatly, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>That day <i class="calibre6">is</i> a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD'S wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.</p></div></body></html>
