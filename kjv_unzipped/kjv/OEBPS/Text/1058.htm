<span class="reftext">2</span>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i class="calibre6">is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i class="calibre6">of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>So we, <i class="calibre6">being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <i class="calibre6">let us prophesy</i> according to the proportion of faith; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Or ministry, <i class="calibre6">let us wait</i> on <i class="calibre6">our</i> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <i class="calibre6">let him do it</i> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="hdg">Love, Zeal, Hope, Hospitality<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 13:31-35; 1 John 3:11-24)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">Let</i> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 
<span class="reftext">10</span><i class="calibre6">Be</i> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>
<p class="hdg">Forgiveness<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 18:21-35)</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. 
<span class="reftext">16</span><i class="calibre6">Be</i> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <i class="calibre6">rather</i> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <i class="calibre6">is</i> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p></div></body></html>
