  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Lord has Chosen Israel</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, <i class="calibre6">which</i> will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>And they shall spring up <i class="calibre6">as</i> among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>One shall say, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD'S; and another shall call <i class="calibre6">himself</i> by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe <i class="calibre6">with</i> his hand unto the LORD, and surname <i class="calibre6">himself</i> by the name of Israel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Only One is God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the first, and I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the last; and beside me <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared <i class="calibre6">it</i>? ye <i class="calibre6">are</i> even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no God; I know not <i class="calibre6">any</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Folly of Idolatry</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>They that make a graven image <i class="calibre6">are</i> all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they <i class="calibre6">are</i> their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image <i class="calibre6">that</i> is profitable for nothing? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they <i class="calibre6">are</i> of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; <i class="calibre6">yet</i> they shall fear, <i class="calibre6">and</i> they shall be ashamed together.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>The carpenter stretcheth out <i class="calibre6">his</i> rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish <i class="calibre6">it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth <i class="calibre6">it</i>; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth <i class="calibre6">himself</i>, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And the residue thereof he maketh a god, <i class="calibre6">even</i> his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my god.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; <i class="calibre6">and</i> their hearts, that they cannot understand. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And none considereth in his heart, neither <i class="calibre6">is there</i> knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten <i class="calibre6">it</i>: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, <i class="calibre6">Is there</i> not a lie in my right hand?</p>
<p class="hdg">Jerusalem to Be Restored</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my servant: I have formed thee; thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done <i class="calibre6">it</i>: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD that maketh all <i class="calibre6">things</i>; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise <i class="calibre6">men</i> backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>That saith of Cyrus, <i class="calibre6">He is</i> my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</p></div></body></html>
