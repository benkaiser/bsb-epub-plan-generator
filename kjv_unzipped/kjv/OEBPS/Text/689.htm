  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Woe to Tyrants</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness <i class="calibre6">which</i> they have prescribed;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> they may rob the fatherless!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation <i class="calibre6">which</i> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <i class="calibre6">is</i> stretched out still.</p>
<p class="hdg">Judgment on Assyria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but <i class="calibre6">it is</i> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For he saith, <i class="calibre6">Are</i> not my princes altogether kings?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">Is</i> not Calno as Carchemish? <i class="calibre6">is</i> not Hamath as Arpad? <i class="calibre6">is</i> not Samaria as Damascus?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Wherefore it shall come to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant <i class="calibre6">man</i>:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs <i class="calibre6">that are</i> left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? <i class="calibre6">or</i> shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake <i class="calibre6">itself</i> against them that lift it up, <i class="calibre6">or</i> as if the staff should lift up <i class="calibre6">itself, as if it were</i> no wood.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Remnant of Israel Shall Return</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The remnant shall return, <i class="calibre6">even</i> the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, <i class="calibre6">yet</i> a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and <i class="calibre6">as</i> his rod <i class="calibre6">was</i> upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, <i class="calibre6">that</i> his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand <i class="calibre6">against</i> the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</p></div></body></html>
