  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Joseph and Potiphar's Wife</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And his master saw that the LORD <i class="calibre6">was</i> with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all <i class="calibre6">that</i> he had he put into his hand. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And it came to pass from the time <i class="calibre6">that</i> he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was <i class="calibre6">a</i> goodly <i class="calibre6">person</i>, and well favoured. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what <i class="calibre6">is</i> with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; 
<span class="reftext">9</span><i class="calibre6">There is</i> none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, <i class="calibre6">or</i> to be with her. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And it came to pass about this time, that <i class="calibre6">Joseph</i> went into the house to do his business; and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none of the men of the house there within. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>
<p class="hdg">Joseph Falsely Imprisoned</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
<span class="reftext">14</span>That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners <i class="calibre6">were</i> bound: and he was there in the prison. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that <i class="calibre6">were</i> in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer <i class="calibre6">of it</i>. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing <i class="calibre6">that was</i> under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> which he did, the LORD made <i class="calibre6">it</i> to prosper.</p></div></body></html>
