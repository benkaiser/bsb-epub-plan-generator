  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Personal Greetings and Love</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Likewise <i class="calibre6">greet</i> the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' <i class="calibre6">household</i>. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the <i class="calibre6">household</i> of Narcissus, which are in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Avoid Divisions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For your obedience is come abroad unto all <i class="calibre6">men</i>. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you. Amen.</p>
<p class="hdg">Greetings from Paul's Companions</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>I Tertius, who wrote <i class="calibre6">this</i> epistle, salute you in the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i class="calibre6">be</i> with you all. Amen.</p>

<span class="reftext">26</span>But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>To God only wise, <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. </p></div></body></html>
