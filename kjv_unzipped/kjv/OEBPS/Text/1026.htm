  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Saul Persecutes the Church</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And devout men carried Stephen <i class="calibre6">to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed <i class="calibre6">them</i> to prison.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philip in Samaria</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i class="calibre6">with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And there was great joy in that city.</p>
<p class="hdg">Simon the Sorcerer<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 18:9-14)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one: 
<span class="reftext">10</span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
<span class="reftext">16</span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Then laid they <i class="calibre6">their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the bond of iniquity. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="hdg">Philip and the Ethiopian</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And Philip ran thither to <i class="calibre6">him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
<span class="reftext">35</span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And as they went on <i class="calibre6">their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i class="calibre6">here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
<span class="reftext">39</span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p></div></body></html>
