<span class="reftext">2</span>Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> his name; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; 
<span class="reftext">5</span>They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but <i class="calibre6">it is</i> to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> desolate without man and without beast, <i class="calibre6">even</i> in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> good; for his mercy <i class="calibre6">endureth</i> for ever: <i class="calibre6">and</i> of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing <i class="calibre6">their</i> flocks to lie down. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth <i class="calibre6">them</i>, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Covenant with David</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this <i class="calibre6">is the name</i> wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season; 
<span class="reftext">21</span><i class="calibre6">Then</i> may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant <i class="calibre6">be</i> not with day and night, <i class="calibre6">and if</i> I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, <i class="calibre6">so</i> that I will not take <i class="calibre6">any</i> of his seed <i class="calibre6">to be</i> rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.</p></div></body></html>
