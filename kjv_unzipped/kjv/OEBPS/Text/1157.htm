  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Greetings from Peter<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(1 Peter 1:1-2)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p class="hdg">Make Your Calling Sure</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i class="calibre6">pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make <i class="calibre6">you that ye shall</i> neither <i class="calibre6">be</i> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="hdg">Remember These Things</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <i class="calibre6">them</i>, and be established in the present truth. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <i class="calibre6">you</i> in remembrance; 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Knowing that shortly I must put off <i class="calibre6">this</i> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</p>
<p class="hdg">We were Eyewitnesses<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 17:1-13; Mark 9:1-13; Luke 9:28-36)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i class="calibre6">as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.</p></div></body></html>
