For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <i class="calibre6">execute</i> wrath upon him that doeth evil. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Wherefore <i class="calibre6">ye</i> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <i class="calibre6">is due</i>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</p>

<span class="reftext">9</span>For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <i class="calibre6">there be</i> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <i class="calibre6">is</i> the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p class="hdg">Clothe Yourselves with Christ</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And that, knowing the time, that now <i class="calibre6">it is</i> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <i class="calibre6">is</i> our salvation nearer than when we believed. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <i class="calibre6">fulfil</i> the lusts <i class="calibre6">thereof</i>.</p></div></body></html>
