<span class="reftext">2</span>And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</p>
