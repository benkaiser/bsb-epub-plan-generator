  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Gold Lampstand</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all <i class="calibre6">of</i> gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon the top thereof: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And two olive trees by it, one upon the right <i class="calibre6">side</i> of the bowl, and the other upon the left <i class="calibre6">side</i> thereof. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What <i class="calibre6">are</i> these, my lord? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <i class="calibre6">is</i> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Who <i class="calibre6">art</i> thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel <i class="calibre6">thou shalt become</i> a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone <i class="calibre6">thereof with</i> shoutings, <i class="calibre6">crying</i>, Grace, grace unto it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel <i class="calibre6">with</i> those seven; they <i class="calibre6">are</i> the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Two Olive Trees</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then answered I, and said unto him, What <i class="calibre6">are</i> these two olive trees upon the right <i class="calibre6">side</i> of the candlestick and upon the left <i class="calibre6">side</i> thereof? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>And I answered again, and said unto him, What <i class="calibre6">be these</i> two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden <i class="calibre6">oil</i> out of themselves? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these <i class="calibre6">be</i>? And I said, No, my lord. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Then said he, These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.</p></div></body></html>
