  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Testing the Spirits</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <i class="calibre6">spirit</i> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p class="hdg">Love Comes from God</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i class="calibre6">to be</i> the propitiation for our sins. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i class="calibre6">to be</i> the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>We love him, because he first loved us. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 
<span class="reftext">21</span>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</p></div></body></html>
