My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; <i class="calibre6">and</i> break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts <i class="calibre6">is</i> the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.</p>
<p class="hdg">Woes to the Wicked</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Woe unto them that join house to house, <i class="calibre6">that</i> lay field to field, till <i class="calibre6">there be</i> no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>In mine ears <i class="calibre6">said</i> the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, <i class="calibre6">even</i> great and fair, without inhabitant.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, <i class="calibre6">that</i> they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, <i class="calibre6">till</i> wine inflame them!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because <i class="calibre6">they have</i> no knowledge: and their honourable men <i class="calibre6">are</i> famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>That say, Let him make speed, <i class="calibre6">and</i> hasten his work, that we may see <i class="calibre6">it</i>: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know <i class="calibre6">it</i>!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>Woe unto <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Woe unto <i class="calibre6">them that are</i> mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, <i class="calibre6">so</i> their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases <i class="calibre6">were</i> torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <i class="calibre6">is</i> stretched out still.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>Whose arrows <i class="calibre6">are</i> sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>Their roaring <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry <i class="calibre6">it</i> away safe, and none shall deliver <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if <i class="calibre6">one</i> look unto the land, behold darkness <i class="calibre6">and</i> sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.</p></div></body></html>
