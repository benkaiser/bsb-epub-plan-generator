  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Our Eternal Dwelling<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 8:18-27)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>For we know that if our earthly house of <i class="calibre6">this</i> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven: 
<span class="reftext">3</span>If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>For we that are in <i class="calibre6">this</i> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <i class="calibre6">is</i> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Therefore <i class="calibre6">we are</i> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
<span class="reftext">8</span>We are confident, <i class="calibre6">I say</i>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i class="calibre6">done</i> in <i class="calibre6">his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i class="calibre6">it be</i> good or bad.</p>
<p class="hdg">We are Christ's Ambassadors</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <i class="calibre6">answer</i> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For whether we be beside ourselves, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> to God: or whether we be sober, <i class="calibre6">it is</i> for your cause. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And <i class="calibre6">that</i> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <i class="calibre6">him</i> no more. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Therefore if any man <i class="calibre6">be</i> in Christ, <i class="calibre6">he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And all things <i class="calibre6">are</i> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
<span class="reftext">19</span>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <i class="calibre6">you</i> by us: we pray <i class="calibre6">you</i> in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>For he hath made him <i class="calibre6">to be</i> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p></div></body></html>
