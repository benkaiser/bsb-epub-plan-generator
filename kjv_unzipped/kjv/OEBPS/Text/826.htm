  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Parable of the Cooking Pot</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">2</span>Son of man, write thee the name of the day, <i class="calibre6">even</i> of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set <i class="calibre6">it</i> on, and also pour water into it:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>Gather the pieces thereof into it, <i class="calibre6">even</i> every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill <i class="calibre6">it</i> with the choice bones.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, <i class="calibre6">and</i> make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum <i class="calibre6">is</i> therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> the filthiness of it may be molten in it, <i class="calibre6">that</i> the scum of it may be consumed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>She hath wearied <i class="calibre6">herself</i> with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> in the fire.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>In thy filthiness <i class="calibre6">is</i> lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>I the LORD have spoken <i class="calibre6">it</i>: it shall come to pass, and I will do <i class="calibre6">it</i>; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="hdg">Ezekiel's Wife Dies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not <i class="calibre6">thy</i> lips, and eat not the bread of men. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <i class="calibre6">things are</i> to us, that thou doest <i class="calibre6">so</i>? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover <i class="calibre6">your</i> lips, nor eat the bread of men. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And your tires <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Also, thou son of man, <i class="calibre6">shall it</i> not <i class="calibre6">be</i> in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters, 
<span class="reftext">26</span><i class="calibre6">That</i> he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause <i class="calibre6">thee</i> to hear <i class="calibre6">it</i> with <i class="calibre6">thine</i> ears? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> the LORD.</p></div></body></html>
