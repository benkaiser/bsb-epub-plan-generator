<span class="reftext">2</span>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And when he sowed, some <i class="calibre6">seeds</i> fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: 
<span class="reftext">8</span>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Purpose of Jesus' Parables<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 4:10-12)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
<span class="reftext">11</span>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and <i class="calibre6">their</i> ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with <i class="calibre6">their</i> eyes, and hear with <i class="calibre6">their</i> ears, and should understand with <i class="calibre6">their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>But blessed <i class="calibre6">are</i> your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous <i class="calibre6">men</i> have desired to see <i class="calibre6">those things</i> which ye see, and have not seen <i class="calibre6">them</i>; and to hear <i class="calibre6">those things</i> which ye hear, and have not heard <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Sower Explained<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 4:13-20)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth <i class="calibre6">it</i> not, then cometh the wicked <i class="calibre6">one</i>, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth <i class="calibre6">it</i>; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Weeds<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Ezekiel 17:1-10)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. 
<span class="reftext">27</span>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? 
<span class="reftext">28</span>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Mustard Seed<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 4:30-34; Luke 13:18-19)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Leaven<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Judges 20:18-23; 2 Samuel 2:12-32; 2 Chronicles 13:4-19; Luke 13:20-21)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="hdg">I will Open My Mouth in Parables<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 78:1-72)</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Weeds Explained<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Zephaniah 1:1-6)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; 
<span class="reftext">38</span>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked <i class="calibre6">one</i>; 
<span class="reftext">39</span>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parables of the Treasure and Pearl<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 6:19-21)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: 
<span class="reftext">46</span>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Parable of the Net<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Matthew 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11; John 1:35-42)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
<span class="reftext">48</span>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 
<span class="reftext">50</span>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">51</span>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe <i class="calibre6">which is</i> instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man <i class="calibre6">that is</i> an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure <i class="calibre6">things</i> new and old.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Rejected at Nazareth<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Isaiah 61:1-11; Matthew 2:19-23; Mark 6:1-6; Luke 2:39-40; Luke 4:16-30)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">53</span>And it came to pass, <i class="calibre6">that</i> when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence. 
<span class="reftext">54</span>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this <i class="calibre6">man</i> this wisdom, and <i class="calibre6">these</i> mighty works? 
<span class="reftext">55</span>Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? 
<span class="reftext">56</span>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this <i class="calibre6">man</i> all these things? 
<span class="reftext">57</span>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house. 
<span class="reftext">58</span>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p></div></body></html>
