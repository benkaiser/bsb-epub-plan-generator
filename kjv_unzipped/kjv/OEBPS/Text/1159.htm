  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Christ's Coming Judgment<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 3:1-7; Genesis 7:1-5; Romans 5:12-21)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i class="calibre6">both</i> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
<span class="reftext">2</span>That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i class="calibre6">they were</i> from the beginning of the creation. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water: 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i class="calibre6">is</i> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Day of the Lord<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Zephaniah 1:7-18; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span><i class="calibre6">Seeing</i> then <i class="calibre6">that</i> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner <i class="calibre6">of persons</i> ought ye to be in <i class="calibre6">all</i> holy conversation and godliness, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
<p class="hdg">Final Exhortations</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And account <i class="calibre6">that</i> the longsuffering of our Lord <i class="calibre6">is</i> salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; 
<span class="reftext">16</span>As also in all <i class="calibre6">his</i> epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as <i class="calibre6">they do</i> also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <i class="calibre6">these things</i> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>But grow in grace, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <i class="calibre6">be</i> glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
