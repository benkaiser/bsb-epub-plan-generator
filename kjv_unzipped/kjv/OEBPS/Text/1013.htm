  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus' Warning<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Acts 23:12-22)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Holy Spirit Promised<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Joel 2:28-32; John 14:15-26; Acts 2:1-13; Acts 10:44-48; Acts 19:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Of sin, because they believe not on me; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i class="calibre6">that</i> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto you. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew <i class="calibre6">it</i> unto you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Disciples' Grief will Turn to Joy</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>Then said <i class="calibre6">some</i> of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? 
<span class="reftext">20</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Ask and You will Receive</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give <i class="calibre6">it</i> you. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p></div></body></html>
