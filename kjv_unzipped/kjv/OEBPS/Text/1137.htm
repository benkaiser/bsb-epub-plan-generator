  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">A Sabbath-Rest for God's People<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus 16:22-36)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <i class="calibre6">us</i> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <i class="calibre6">day</i> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And in this <i class="calibre6">place</i> again, If they shall enter into my rest. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i class="calibre6">did</i> from his. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Word is Living and Active</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>For the word of God <i class="calibre6">is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i class="calibre6">is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things <i class="calibre6">are</i> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus the Great High Priest</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i class="calibre6">our</i> profession. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i class="calibre6">we are, yet</i> without sin. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p></div></body></html>
