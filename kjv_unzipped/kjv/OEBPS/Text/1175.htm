<span class="reftext">2</span>And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer <i class="calibre6">it</i> with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And the smoke of the incense, <i class="calibre6">which came</i> with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast <i class="calibre6">it</i> into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</p>
<p class="hdg">The First Four Trumpets</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!</p></div></body></html>
