<span class="reftext">2</span>For kings, and <i class="calibre6">for</i> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>For this <i class="calibre6">is</i> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>For <i class="calibre6">there is</i> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <i class="calibre6">and</i> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="hdg">Instructions to Women</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</p></div></body></html>
