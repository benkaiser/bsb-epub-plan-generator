<span class="reftext">2</span>A cubit <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the height thereof: the horns thereof <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> of the same. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make <i class="calibre6">it</i>; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And thou shalt make the staves <i class="calibre6">of</i> shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And thou shalt put it before the vail that <i class="calibre6">is</i> by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that <i class="calibre6">is</i> over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> most holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Atonement Money</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">12</span>When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when <i class="calibre6">thou</i> numberest them. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel <i class="calibre6">is</i> twenty gerahs:) an half shekel <i class="calibre6">shall be</i> the offering of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when <i class="calibre6">they</i> give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Bronze Basin</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>Thou shalt also make a laver <i class="calibre6">of</i> brass, and his foot <i class="calibre6">also of</i> brass, to wash <i class="calibre6">withal</i>: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> to him and to his seed throughout their generations.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Anointing Oil</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred <i class="calibre6">shekels</i>, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, <i class="calibre6">even</i> two hundred and fifty <i class="calibre6">shekels</i>, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty <i class="calibre6">shekels</i>, 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And of cassia five hundred <i class="calibre6">shekels</i>, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 
<span class="reftext">28</span>And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that <i class="calibre6">they</i> may minister unto me in the priest's office. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make <i class="calibre6">any other</i> like it, after the composition of it: it <i class="calibre6">is</i> holy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> it shall be holy unto you. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>Whosoever compoundeth <i class="calibre6">any</i> like it, or whosoever putteth <i class="calibre6">any</i> of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Incense</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; <i class="calibre6">these</i> sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like <i class="calibre6">weight</i>: 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure <i class="calibre6">and</i> holy: 
<span class="reftext">36</span>And thou shalt beat <i class="calibre6">some</i> of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>And <i class="calibre6">as for</i> the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.</p></div></body></html>
