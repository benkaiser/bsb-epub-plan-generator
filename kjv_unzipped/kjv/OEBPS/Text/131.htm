  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The People Rebel<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 1:26-33)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i class="calibre6">which were</i> of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 
<span class="reftext">7</span>And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, <i class="calibre6">is</i> an exceeding good land. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they <i class="calibre6">are</i> bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> with us: fear them not. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</p>
<p class="hdg">Moses Intercedes for the People</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear <i class="calibre6">it</i>, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they will tell <i class="calibre6">it</i> to the inhabitants of this land: <i class="calibre6">for</i> they have heard that thou LORD <i class="calibre6">art</i> among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> thy cloud standeth over them, and <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>Now <i class="calibre6">if</i> thou shalt kill <i class="calibre6">all</i> this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 
<span class="reftext">16</span>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 
<span class="reftext">18</span>The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing <i class="calibre6">the guilty</i>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i class="calibre6">generation</i>. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</p>
<p class="hdg">God's Forgiveness and Judgment<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 1:34-40)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But <i class="calibre6">as</i> truly <i class="calibre6">as</i> I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 
<span class="reftext">24</span>But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
<span class="reftext">27</span>How long <i class="calibre6">shall I bear with</i> this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Say unto them, <i class="calibre6">As truly as</i> I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 
<span class="reftext">29</span>Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, <i class="calibre6">concerning</i> which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>But <i class="calibre6">as for</i> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 
<span class="reftext">34</span>After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, <i class="calibre6">even</i> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, <i class="calibre6">even</i> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Plague on the Ten Spies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 
<span class="reftext">37</span>Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i class="calibre6">which were</i> of the men that went to search the land, lived <i class="calibre6">still</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p>
<p class="hdg">Defeat by Amalekites and Canaanites</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we <i class="calibre6">be here</i>, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. 
<span class="reftext">42</span>Go not up, for the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>For the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i class="calibre6">are</i> there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. 
<span class="reftext">44</span>But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto Hormah.</p></div></body></html>
