  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Invasion of Locusts</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Tell ye your children of it, and <i class="calibre6">let</i> your children <i class="calibre6">tell</i> their children, and their children another generation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth <i class="calibre6">are</i> the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast <i class="calibre6">it</i> away; the branches thereof are made white.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Call to Mourning</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD'S ministers, mourn.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, <i class="calibre6">even</i> all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</p>
<p class="hdg">A Call to Repentance<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Amos 5:4-15; Zephaniah 2:1-3; Luke 13:1-5)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders <i class="calibre6">and</i> all the inhabitants of the land <i class="calibre6">into</i> the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, <i class="calibre6">yea</i>, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p></div></body></html>
