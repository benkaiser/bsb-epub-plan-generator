  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Resurrection<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Psalm 16:1-11; Psalm 49:1-20; Matthew 28:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; John 20:1-9)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Now upon the first <i class="calibre6">day</i> of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain <i class="calibre6">others</i> with them. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
<span class="reftext">5</span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down <i class="calibre6">their</i> faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 
<span class="reftext">8</span>And they remembered his words, 
<span class="reftext">9</span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary <i class="calibre6">the mother</i> of James, and other <i class="calibre6">women that were</i> with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Road to Emmaus<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 16:12-13)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem <i class="calibre6">about</i> threescore furlongs. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed <i class="calibre6">together</i> and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And he said unto them, What manner of communications <i class="calibre6">are</i> these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
<span class="reftext">18</span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
<span class="reftext">19</span>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found <i class="calibre6">it</i> even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Explains the Prophecies</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: 
<span class="reftext">26</span>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? 
<span class="reftext">27</span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and brake, and gave to them. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
<span class="reftext">32</span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
<span class="reftext">33</span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
<span class="reftext">34</span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
<span class="reftext">35</span>And they told what things <i class="calibre6">were done</i> in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Appears to the Disciples<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(John 20:19-23; 1 John 1:1-4)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace <i class="calibre6">be</i> unto you. 
<span class="reftext">37</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
<span class="reftext">38</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 
<span class="reftext">39</span>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 
<span class="reftext">40</span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them <i class="calibre6">his</i> hands and <i class="calibre6">his</i> feet. 
<span class="reftext">41</span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? 
<span class="reftext">42</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
<span class="reftext">43</span>And he took <i class="calibre6">it</i>, and did eat before them.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Opens the Meaning of Scriptures</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>And he said unto them, These <i class="calibre6">are</i> the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the prophets, and <i class="calibre6">in</i> the psalms, concerning me. 
<span class="reftext">45</span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 
<span class="reftext">46</span>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: 
<span class="reftext">47</span>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">48</span>And ye are witnesses of these things. 
<span class="reftext">49</span>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Ascension<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1:6-11)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 
<span class="reftext">51</span>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. 
<span class="reftext">52</span>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
<span class="reftext">53</span>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p></div></body></html>
