<span class="reftext">5</span>Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God blessed him. 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they <i class="calibre6">were</i> mighty men of valour. 
<span class="reftext">7</span>The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose brethren <i class="calibre6">were</i> strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

<span class="reftext">9</span>And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen. 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for <i class="calibre6">though</i> he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the chief;) 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brethren of Hosah <i class="calibre6">were</i> thirteen.</p>

<span class="reftext">13</span>And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counseller, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 
<span class="reftext">15</span>To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>To Shuppim and Hosah <i class="calibre6">the lot came forth</i> westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.
