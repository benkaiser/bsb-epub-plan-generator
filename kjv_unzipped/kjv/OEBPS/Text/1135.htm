  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Pay Attention to Salvation</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <i class="calibre6">them</i> slip. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; 
<span class="reftext">3</span>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard <i class="calibre6">him</i>; 
<span class="reftext">4</span>God also bearing <i class="calibre6">them</i> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Made Like His Brothers</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <i class="calibre6">that is</i> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>For it became him, for whom <i class="calibre6">are</i> all things, and by whom <i class="calibre6">are</i> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <i class="calibre6">are</i> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; 
<span class="reftext">15</span>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For verily he took not on <i class="calibre6">him the nature of</i> angels; but he took on <i class="calibre6">him</i> the seed of Abraham. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <i class="calibre6">his</i> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <i class="calibre6">pertaining</i> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p></div></body></html>
