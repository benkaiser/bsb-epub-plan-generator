<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span><i class="calibre6">One</i> generation passeth away, and <i class="calibre6">another</i> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea <i class="calibre6">is</i> not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>All things <i class="calibre6">are</i> full of labour; man cannot utter <i class="calibre6">it</i>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>The thing that hath been, it <i class="calibre6">is that</i> which shall be; and that which is done <i class="calibre6">is</i> that which shall be done: and <i class="calibre6">there is</i> no new <i class="calibre6">thing</i> under the sun.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Is there <i class="calibre6">any</i> thing whereof it may be said, See, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</p>

<p class="hdg">With Wisdom Comes Sorrow</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <i class="calibre6">things</i> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all <i class="calibre6">is</i> vanity and vexation of spirit. 
<span class="reftext">15</span><i class="calibre6">That which is</i> crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <i class="calibre6">they</i> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 
<span class="reftext">17</span>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>For in much wisdom <i class="calibre6">is</i> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p></div></body></html>
