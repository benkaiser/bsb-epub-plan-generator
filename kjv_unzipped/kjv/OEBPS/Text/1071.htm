  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">The Rights of the Apostles<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Deuteronomy 18:1-8)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
<span class="reftext">2</span>If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
<span class="reftext">4</span>Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
<span class="reftext">5</span>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <i class="calibre6">as</i> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 
<span class="reftext">7</span>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
<span class="reftext">9</span>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Or saith he <i class="calibre6">it</i> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <i class="calibre6">this</i> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <i class="calibre6">is it</i> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? 
<span class="reftext">12</span>If others be partakers of <i class="calibre6">this</i> power over you, <i class="calibre6">are</i> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <i class="calibre6">of the things</i> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? 
<span class="reftext">14</span>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <i class="calibre6">it were</i> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 
<span class="reftext">16</span>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 
<span class="reftext">17</span>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <i class="calibre6">of the gospel</i> is committed unto me. 
<span class="reftext">18</span>What is my reward then? <i class="calibre6">Verily</i> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
<p class="hdg">Paul a Servant to All</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>For though I be free from all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 
<span class="reftext">21</span>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <i class="calibre6">men</i>, that I might by all means save some. 
<span class="reftext">23</span>And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <i class="calibre6">you</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Run Your Race to Win</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
<span class="reftext">25</span>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <i class="calibre6">do it</i> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: 
<span class="reftext">27</span>But I keep under my body, and bring <i class="calibre6">it</i> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</p></div></body></html>
