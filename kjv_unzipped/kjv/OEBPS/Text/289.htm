<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>And he said, The LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>The God of my rock; in him will I trust: <i class="calibre6">he is</i> my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>I will call on the LORD, <i class="calibre6">who is</i> worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry <i class="calibre6">did enter</i> into his ears.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness <i class="calibre6">was</i> under his feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, <i class="calibre6">and</i> thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">17</span>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>He delivered me from my strong enemy, <i class="calibre6">and</i> from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">19</span>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">20</span>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">21</span>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">22</span>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">23</span>For all his judgments <i class="calibre6">were</i> before me: and <i class="calibre6">as for</i> his statutes, I did not depart from them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">24</span>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">26</span>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, <i class="calibre6">and</i> with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">28</span>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes <i class="calibre6">are</i> upon the haughty, <i class="calibre6">that</i> thou mayest bring <i class="calibre6">them</i> down.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">29</span>For thou <i class="calibre6">art</i> my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">30</span>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">31</span><i class="calibre6">As for</i> God, his way <i class="calibre6">is</i> perfect; the word of the LORD <i class="calibre6">is</i> tried: he <i class="calibre6">is</i> a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">32</span>For who <i class="calibre6">is</i> God, save the LORD? and who <i class="calibre6">is</i> a rock, save our God?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">33</span>God <i class="calibre6">is</i> my strength <i class="calibre6">and</i> power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">34</span>He maketh my feet like hinds' <i class="calibre6">feet</i>: and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">35</span>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">36</span>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">37</span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">38</span>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">39</span>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">40</span>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">41</span>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">42</span>They looked, but <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none to save; <i class="calibre6">even</i> unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">43</span>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, <i class="calibre6">and</i> did spread them abroad.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">44</span>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me <i class="calibre6">to be</i> head of the heathen: a people <i class="calibre6">which</i> I knew not shall serve me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">45</span>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">46</span>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">47</span>The LORD liveth; and blessed <i class="calibre6">be</i> my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">48</span>It <i class="calibre6">is</i> God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">49</span>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">50</span>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">51</span><i class="calibre6">He is</i> the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p></div></body></html>
