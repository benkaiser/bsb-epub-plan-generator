O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>The dead bodies of thy servants have they given <i class="calibre6">to be</i> meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and <i class="calibre6">there was</i> none to bury <i class="calibre6">them</i>.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Wherefore should the heathen say, Where <i class="calibre6">is</i> their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight <i class="calibre6">by</i> the revenging of the blood of thy servants <i class="calibre6">which is</i> shed.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p></div></body></html>
