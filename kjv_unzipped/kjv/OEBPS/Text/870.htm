<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">2</span>Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">3</span>Israel hath cast off <i class="calibre6">the thing that is</i> good: the enemy shall pursue him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">4</span>They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew <i class="calibre6">it</i> not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast <i class="calibre6">thee</i> off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long <i class="calibre6">will it be</i> ere they attain to innocency?</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">6</span>For from Israel <i class="calibre6">was</i> it also: the workman made it; therefore it <i class="calibre6">is</i> not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein <i class="calibre6">is</i> no pleasure.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">9</span>For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">10</span>Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">11</span>Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">12</span>I have written to him the great things of my law, <i class="calibre6">but</i> they were counted as a strange thing.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">13</span>They sacrifice flesh <i class="calibre6">for</i> the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat <i class="calibre6">it; but</i> the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">14</span>For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</p></div></body></html>
