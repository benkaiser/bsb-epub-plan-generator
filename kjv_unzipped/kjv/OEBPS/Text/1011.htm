  <body class="calibre"><div class="calibre1"><p class="hdg">Jesus Comforts the Disciples</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">1</span>Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. 
<span class="reftext">2</span>In my Father's house are many mansions: if <i class="calibre6">it were</i> not <i class="calibre6">so</i>, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 
<span class="reftext">3</span>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <i class="calibre6">there</i> ye may be also. 
<span class="reftext">4</span>And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</p>
<p class="hdg">The Way, the Truth, and the Life</p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">5</span>Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? 
<span class="reftext">6</span>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">7</span>If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">8</span>Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
<span class="reftext">9</span>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou <i class="calibre6">then</i>, Shew us the Father? 
<span class="reftext">10</span>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 
<span class="reftext">11</span>Believe me that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake. 
<span class="reftext">12</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater <i class="calibre6">works</i> than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 
<span class="reftext">13</span>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 
<span class="reftext">14</span>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do <i class="calibre6">it</i>.</p>
<p class="hdg">Jesus Promises the Holy Spirit<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Joel 2:28-32; John 16:5-16; Acts 2:1-13; Acts 10:44-48; Acts 19:1-7)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">15</span>If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">16</span>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; 
<span class="reftext">17</span><i class="calibre6">Even</i> the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">18</span>I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. 
<span class="reftext">19</span>Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. 
<span class="reftext">20</span>At that day ye shall know that I <i class="calibre6">am</i> in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. 
<span class="reftext">21</span>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. 
<span class="reftext">22</span>Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
<span class="reftext">23</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. 
<span class="reftext">24</span>He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext">25</span>These things have I spoken unto you, being <i class="calibre6">yet</i> present with you. 
<span class="reftext">26</span>But the Comforter, <i class="calibre6">which is</i> the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>
<p class="hdg">Peace I Leave with You<br class="calibre1"/></p><p class="cross">(Romans 5:1-5)</p><p class="calibre5"></p><p class="reg"><span class="reftext">27</span>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 
<span class="reftext">28</span>Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come <i class="calibre6">again</i> unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. 
<span class="reftext">29</span>And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. 
<span class="reftext">30</span>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. 
<span class="reftext">31</span>But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p></div></body></html>
